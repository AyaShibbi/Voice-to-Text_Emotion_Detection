sample-283.wav,the path through the forest was unlit and scary
sample-284.wav,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly

sample-322.wav,with a bag of marshmallows
sample-323.wav,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-324.wav,i want those stamps

sample-374.wav,one key is for encryption the other one for decryption
sample-375.wav,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
