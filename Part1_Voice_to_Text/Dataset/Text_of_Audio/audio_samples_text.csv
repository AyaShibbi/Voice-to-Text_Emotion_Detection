sample-416.wav,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-417.wav,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-418.wav,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
sample-419.wav,the heat lasted until nightfall and all that time he had to carry his jacket
sample-420.wav,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-421.wav,it seemed as if what the old king had called beginner's luck were no longer functioning
sample-422.wav,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-423.wav,and to do that you need money
sample-424.wav,you should see his fan mail
sample-425.wav,a drought hit western europe
sample-426.wav,i get more of a kick out of it that way
sample-427.wav,that's all you are
sample-428.wav,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-429.wav,everyone should have health insurance
sample-430.wav,we're just slowly plodding through some user interviews at the moment
sample-431.wav,nearby was the englishman reading a book
sample-432.wav,i won a flower
sample-433.wav,where do you live
sample-434.wav,my review of the sun one star
sample-435.wav,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-436.wav,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
sample-437.wav,i want to see the chieftains
sample-438.wav,i could have helped her
sample-439.wav,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-440.wav,the boy went to look for the englishman
sample-441.wav,it was the old man who spoke first
sample-442.wav,i'm not going to charge you anything now she said
sample-443.wav,people say strange things the boy thought
sample-444.wav,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-445.wav,there was very little talking
sample-446.wav,and in that way the months passed
sample-447.wav,to nourish the falcon
sample-448.wav,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-449.wav,it's awfully clear now
sample-450.wav,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-451.wav,this is keith miller
sample-452.wav,the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-453.wav,the sheep had taught him that
sample-454.wav,what's your name he asked
sample-455.wav,the pink love heart keyring glowed
sample-456.wav,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-457.wav,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-458.wav,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-459.wav,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-460.wav,can i get a woot woot
sample-461.wav,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
sample-462.wav,one night the father had a dream
sample-463.wav,the boy picked up his pouch and put it with his other things
sample-464.wav,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
sample-465.wav,i should have been there
sample-466.wav,don't ask me why i don't know why
sample-467.wav,this is the first phase of the job he said
sample-468.wav,since then i haven't been able to get another one
sample-469.wav,this is a very interesting situation
sample-470.wav,you certainly delivered the goods
sample-471.wav,this is christmas eve
sample-472.wav,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-473.wav,how did you find out
sample-474.wav,the alchemist lighted the fire and soon a delicious aroma filled the tent
sample-475.wav,they ate in silence
sample-476.wav,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-477.wav,they returned to the gates of the monastery
sample-478.wav,the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-479.wav,and it knew nothing about love
sample-480.wav,i'm going to them
sample-481.wav,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-482.wav,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
sample-483.wav,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
sample-484.wav,we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
sample-485.wav,never stop dreaming the old king had said
sample-486.wav,he paused and his eyes were still unfriendly
sample-487.wav,until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
sample-488.wav,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-489.wav,and they had understood each other perfectly well
sample-490.wav,do you know that i threw it away
sample-491.wav,another trick the boy thought
sample-492.wav,you're playing with dynamite
sample-493.wav,then he realized that he had been distracted for a few moments looking at the sword
sample-494.wav,are you coming tomorrow
sample-495.wav,since the miner had sacrificed everything to his destiny the old man decided to become involved
sample-496.wav,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-497.wav,i've got indigestion
sample-498.wav,he is going to transform himself into the wind just to demonstrate his powers
sample-499.wav,it's going to take a while the boy said
sample-5.wav,listen don't believe what he says
sample-501.wav,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-502.wav,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-503.wav,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
sample-504.wav,she used her microscope to inspect it
sample-505.wav,will you get close to him
sample-506.wav,are there any other questions
sample-507.wav,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
sample-508.wav,did you get the mayor
sample-509.wav,they said nothing else
sample-510.wav,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-511.wav,it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
sample-512.wav,why do you want to find that sort of person the arab asked
sample-513.wav,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
sample-514.wav,he'll be ready on time
sample-515.wav,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-516.wav,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
sample-517.wav,except for the dream
sample-518.wav,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-519.wav,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
sample-520.wav,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
sample-521.wav,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
sample-522.wav,so you got married
sample-523.wav,i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
sample-524.wav,in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
sample-525.wav,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-526.wav,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-527.wav,the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
sample-528.wav,he instead offers an alternate explanation that relates to site scalability issues
sample-529.wav,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-530.wav,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-531.wav,she placed the glass carefully on the edge of the table
sample-532.wav,because you will never again be able to keep it quiet
sample-533.wav,i can send contextual information to it from other apps
sample-534.wav,everyone seemed very excited
sample-535.wav,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
sample-536.wav,she wasn't her type
sample-537.wav,i'll have it in a minute
sample-538.wav,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-539.wav,you can hear out of it
sample-540.wav,but she said nothing
sample-541.wav,i think i found something
sample-542.wav,and then there were the others who were interested only in gold
sample-543.wav,may i go in and see him
sample-544.wav,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
sample-545.wav,what do you mean by that
sample-546.wav,maybe that's why they came
sample-547.wav,i know that girl
sample-548.wav,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
sample-549.wav,it's a private club for only the most respectable people
sample-550.wav,we migrated our stuff from mac os to linux
sample-551.wav,too much food is being wasted
sample-552.wav,other servants maintained the fires in the hookahs
sample-553.wav,you got someplace to sleep
sample-554.wav,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
sample-555.wav,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-556.wav,but none of that is from the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-557.wav,that insane android continues to ignore me
sample-558.wav,but then he stopped
sample-559.wav,what is love the desert asked
sample-560.wav,better bring me a glass of milk
sample-561.wav,are you sure this is claire
sample-562.wav,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-563.wav,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-564.wav,she spoke swedish he spoke spanish
sample-565.wav,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-566.wav,do not do tomorrow what you could do today
sample-567.wav,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-568.wav,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-569.wav,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-570.wav,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-571.wav,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
sample-572.wav,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-573.wav,is this the ear you can't hear on
sample-574.wav,during one of these conversations the driver told of his own life
sample-575.wav,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-576.wav,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-577.wav,you'll live and you'll learn that a man shouldn't be so stupid
sample-578.wav,it was a mega monster made of metal
sample-579.wav,what have you got to report
sample-580.wav,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-581.wav,go and speak to the tribal chieftains said the camel driver
sample-582.wav,a lot of patience but shepherds know all about patience
sample-583.wav,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
sample-584.wav,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-585.wav,even if you cleaned my crystal for an entire year
sample-586.wav,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-587.wav,he's doing it because it's what he wants to do
sample-588.wav,and one or two persons were returning
sample-589.wav,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-590.wav,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
sample-591.wav,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-592.wav,he didn't want any conversation at this point
sample-593.wav,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
sample-594.wav,first they tried to find him on their own
sample-595.wav,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-596.wav,how could you even think that
sample-597.wav,jackson was glad that he'd wore kevlar that morning
sample-598.wav,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
sample-599.wav,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-6.wav,the boy was startled
sample-601.wav,the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
sample-602.wav,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
sample-603.wav,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-604.wav,he took out his money and counted it
sample-605.wav,this is unfair
sample-606.wav,the relief on her face showed that she understood
sample-607.wav,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-608.wav,he had tried in vain to establish a relationship with an alchemist
sample-609.wav,but i'd like to see the castles in the towns where they live the boy explained
sample-610.wav,i knows i'm a luxury
sample-611.wav,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-612.wav,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-613.wav,once to the thief and once to the general
sample-614.wav,i want to see him do it said the chief
sample-615.wav,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-616.wav,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-617.wav,but the boy was too frightened to listen to words of wisdom
sample-618.wav,amy's a genius at research
sample-619.wav,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-620.wav,but he decided to take a chance
sample-621.wav,they always do that
sample-622.wav,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-623.wav,they placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses
sample-624.wav,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
sample-625.wav,no that's not what i mean
sample-626.wav,maybe it was because they moved around so much
sample-627.wav,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
sample-628.wav,i think it's about bird hunting but now i can see how that might be misinterpreted
sample-629.wav,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-630.wav,when talking to someone who has just started to learn the language its good to speak slowly and clearly
sample-631.wav,he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
sample-632.wav,the wind began to pick up
sample-633.wav,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
sample-634.wav,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-635.wav,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-636.wav,is that screwball pitpat still around
sample-637.wav,love required them to stay with the people they loved
sample-638.wav,he's in the insurance business
sample-639.wav,it was repetitious but soothing
sample-640.wav,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-641.wav,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-642.wav,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-643.wav,so now i fear nothing because it was those omens that brought you to me
sample-644.wav,i'm the leader of the caravan said a darkeyed bearded man
sample-645.wav,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
sample-646.wav,he had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said
sample-647.wav,two more months passed and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop
sample-648.wav,i don't want any plastics
sample-649.wav,this puts me in a peculiar hole
sample-650.wav,i'm going to tell your mother on you
sample-651.wav,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-652.wav,i don't want anything else in life
sample-653.wav,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-654.wav,the boy began again to read his book but he was no longer able to concentrate
sample-655.wav,after all what he had always wanted was just that to know new places
sample-656.wav,take your paws off me
sample-657.wav,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
sample-658.wav,you've got to do something
sample-659.wav,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
sample-660.wav,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-661.wav,next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al fayoum
sample-662.wav,don't you know that girl's very sick
sample-663.wav,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-664.wav,spain is producing lots of lettuce paprika and tomatoes
sample-665.wav,his hands began to tremble and the woman sensed it
sample-666.wav,you put something wrong in those capsules
sample-667.wav,he reached over and picked up a shell from the ground
sample-668.wav,he knew he was stronger than his friend
sample-669.wav,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-670.wav,it's the only one they had left
sample-671.wav,they reached the center of a large plaza where the market was held
sample-672.wav,how do people celebrate good weather over there
sample-673.wav,there was a thud like the fall of a great mass
sample-674.wav,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-675.wav,don't say anything fatima interrupted
sample-676.wav,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
sample-677.wav,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
sample-678.wav,except for my ulcers
sample-679.wav,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-680.wav,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
sample-681.wav,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
sample-682.wav,and then he would ask us to go back to our easels and replicate all the techniques in one go
sample-683.wav,but the englishman appeared not to attach any importance to it
sample-684.wav,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-685.wav,they didn't have the printing press in those days the boy argued
sample-686.wav,he won't leave the circle
sample-687.wav,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-688.wav,but everyone and his aunt lilian's been through that bag
sample-689.wav,i got it all ready
sample-690.wav,all things are one the old man had said
sample-691.wav,the boy turned to the hand that wrote all
sample-692.wav,i looked at the cylinder again and was completely terrified
sample-693.wav,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-694.wav,those gypsies are really smart he thought
sample-695.wav,it isn't the money
sample-696.wav,if he abandons that pursuit it's because it wasn't truelove
sample-697.wav,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-698.wav,he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
sample-699.wav,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
sample-7.wav,now what are you going to do
sample-701.wav,that's true the boy thought
sample-702.wav,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
sample-703.wav,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-704.wav,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
sample-705.wav,today i understand something i didn't see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse
sample-706.wav,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
sample-707.wav,then whose is it
sample-708.wav,two horsemen waiting ahead of them
sample-709.wav,but you know that i'm not going to go to mecca
sample-710.wav,who wrote that speech for you
sample-711.wav,the article should discuss possible approaches to image registration
sample-712.wav,maybe we're all that way the boy mused
sample-713.wav,but they were not there
sample-714.wav,now i too will be one of the women who wait
sample-715.wav,it's easy and yet i've never done it before he thought
sample-716.wav,i think maybe you'd better
sample-717.wav,see if we can move it
sample-718.wav,now his intuition was that he had been right in coming
sample-719.wav,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-720.wav,it's just that i never have
sample-721.wav,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-722.wav,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-723.wav,you old sorcerer the boy shouted up to the sky
sample-724.wav,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-725.wav,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
sample-726.wav,all things are one the boy thought
sample-727.wav,almost everyone here speaks spanish
sample-728.wav,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-729.wav,it was a a kind of fascination that paralysed my actions
sample-730.wav,they're always after me for interviews
sample-731.wav,what good is money to you if you're going to die
sample-732.wav,advancing slowly they searched among the stones
sample-733.wav,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-734.wav,was the doctor here
sample-735.wav,put jackie right on the staff
sample-736.wav,she wants to send you on a lecture tour
sample-737.wav,but as he saw them lying there on the ground another phrase came to his mind
sample-738.wav,because you have already lost your savings twice
sample-739.wav,the dead soldiers were replaced by others and life went on
sample-740.wav,i didn't know shepherds knew how to read said a girl's voice behind him
sample-741.wav,i learned how to care for sheep and i haven't forgotten how that's done
sample-742.wav,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-743.wav,to nourish the falcon
sample-744.wav,the little group of people from the city dispersed
sample-745.wav,why didn't you tell me
sample-746.wav,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-747.wav,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said
sample-748.wav,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-749.wav,but he certainly didn't desire that an army invade the oasis
sample-750.wav,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-751.wav,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-752.wav,they worked from early morning till late evening
sample-753.wav,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
sample-754.wav,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-755.wav,the alchemist turned to the boy
sample-756.wav,then the two went off to have some more tea
sample-757.wav,the alchemist probably already knew all that
sample-758.wav,that's an inherent disadvantage
sample-759.wav,i can only tell you what i saw
sample-760.wav,he really was a king a wise king
sample-761.wav,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
sample-762.wav,in alchemy it's called the soul of the world
sample-763.wav,i read only what the birds wanted to tell me
sample-764.wav,a practice of infidels he said to himself
sample-765.wav,he was older and was carrying a small bucket
sample-766.wav,the boy took out urim and thummim from his bag
sample-767.wav,the fine manufacturing company was a bookkeeper for fourteen years
sample-768.wav,that's a lot of hooey
sample-769.wav,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-770.wav,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-771.wav,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
sample-772.wav,you can't do that
sample-773.wav,we need to be confident all of us he proposed a solution
sample-774.wav,make you're a hero sure as you're born
sample-775.wav,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-776.wav,finally a young woman approached who was not dressed in black
sample-777.wav,the area was swirling in dust so intense that it hid the moon from view
sample-778.wav,the englishman was disappointed
sample-779.wav,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-780.wav,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
sample-781.wav,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-782.wav,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
sample-783.wav,then why should they be surprised when they see one
sample-784.wav,the ranger took his rifle and went into the forest to shoot the bear
sample-785.wav,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
sample-786.wav,the alchemist opened a bottle and poured a red liquid into the boy's cup
sample-787.wav,neither the radar nor the other instruments detected the stealth bomber
sample-788.wav,it reminded him of the wool from his sheep
sample-789.wav,you're not asking a favor of him
sample-790.wav,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-791.wav,maybe tomorrow said the boy moving away
sample-792.wav,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
sample-793.wav,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
sample-794.wav,he rose and made his way back toward the palm trees
sample-795.wav,i have never seen a rothschild before
sample-796.wav,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-797.wav,the boy looked out at the horizon
sample-798.wav,i didn't frisk him
sample-799.wav,it was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant
sample-8.wav,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-801.wav,that was his work
sample-802.wav,she's going to lose her mind when she finds out
sample-803.wav,something older than humanity more ancient than the desert
sample-804.wav,keep me here until i get over it
sample-805.wav,the boys'll be coming back to phone
sample-806.wav,the scottish parliament contains politicians
sample-807.wav,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
sample-808.wav,that night he told all of this to the alchemist
sample-809.wav,i'm talking about the building and loan
sample-810.wav,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
sample-811.wav,the merchants were assembling their stalls and the boy helped a candy seller to do his
sample-812.wav,maktub thought the boy
sample-813.wav,the next day the boy returned to the well hoping to see the girl
sample-814.wav,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
sample-815.wav,business has really improved he said to the boy after the customer had left
sample-816.wav,the shop was busy and the man asked the shepherd to wait until the afternoon
sample-817.wav,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-818.wav,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
sample-819.wav,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-820.wav,come on in here now
sample-821.wav,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
sample-822.wav,in his heart he wanted to remain awake but he also wanted to sleep
sample-823.wav,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
sample-824.wav,but everything had changed
sample-825.wav,the hand with the whip pointed to the south
sample-826.wav,i got ways of making them talk
sample-827.wav,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sample-828.wav,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-829.wav,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-830.wav,i wouldn't live in it as a ghost
sample-831.wav,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
sample-832.wav,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-833.wav,and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself
sample-834.wav,the omens had told him so
sample-835.wav,the pink love heart keyring glowed
sample-836.wav,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-837.wav,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-838.wav,i forgot my hat
sample-839.wav,you knew the whole story
sample-840.wav,i like cyndi wayne
sample-841.wav,if you pay attention to the present you can improve upon it
sample-842.wav,work has been rough in the last few months because of a major project launch
sample-843.wav,the boy watched the exchange with fascination
sample-844.wav,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-845.wav,he told her about the morning's meeting
sample-846.wav,those are the rules of war the leader explained
sample-847.wav,but his heart was speaking of other things
sample-848.wav,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-849.wav,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
sample-850.wav,he had never imagined that questions about life would be of such importance to a shepherd
sample-851.wav,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-852.wav,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
sample-853.wav,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
sample-854.wav,the boy looked around for the ovens and other apparatus used in alchemy but saw none
sample-855.wav,and seizing the boy's bag the alchemist gave the gold coins to the chief
sample-856.wav,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-857.wav,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-858.wav,i'm hunting with my falcon the alchemist answered
sample-859.wav,there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
sample-860.wav,they were strange books
sample-861.wav,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
sample-862.wav,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-863.wav,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-864.wav,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-865.wav,but i was also stumbling because i couldnt look away from these things
sample-866.wav,there's millions of ways
sample-867.wav,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
sample-868.wav,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-869.wav,there are rumors of tribal wars he told them
sample-870.wav,even if you're an expert reading all of it is often not feasible due to lack of time
sample-871.wav,robin had some sort of date with tracy
sample-872.wav,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
sample-873.wav,modern sewing machines can throttle their speed
sample-874.wav,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-875.wav,you can't say that about my father
sample-876.wav,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-877.wav,the usage of high information content is meaningless
sample-878.wav,the boy continued to listen to his heart as they crossed the desert
sample-879.wav,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-880.wav,instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
sample-881.wav,you don't know scott
sample-882.wav,but maybe i'll never have another chance to get to the pyramids in egypt
sample-883.wav,always heed the omens the old king had said
sample-884.wav,and this is for me said the alchemist keeping one of the parts
sample-885.wav,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
sample-886.wav,like crickets and like expectations like lizards and fourleaf clovers
sample-887.wav,he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
sample-888.wav,that's not my money
sample-889.wav,is he really supposed to read that many books on philosophy
sample-890.wav,i get thirty dollars a week
sample-891.wav,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
sample-892.wav,and it knew nothing about love
sample-893.wav,oh its not such a big deal right away
sample-894.wav,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-895.wav,the boy closed his book
sample-896.wav,however the article is written poorly and incomprehensibly
sample-897.wav,the microphone put out a muffled signal
sample-898.wav,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-899.wav,i'm afraid you're blocking my view
sample-9.wav,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
sample-901.wav,maybe we're all that way the boy mused
sample-902.wav,they walked in from the rain all dishevelled and steaming
sample-903.wav,he could always become a crystal salesman again
sample-904.wav,the old man wore a breastplate of heavy gold covered with precious stones
sample-905.wav,i sold crystal and crossed the desert
sample-906.wav,the ladder of the fire truck was not long enough
sample-907.wav,is she coming back here
sample-908.wav,they called it the simum and it was worse than a storm at sea
sample-909.wav,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-910.wav,when you are loved you can do anything in creation
sample-911.wav,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-912.wav,we're all excited around here
sample-913.wav,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
sample-914.wav,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-915.wav,the alchemist is two hundred years old the englishman had told him
sample-916.wav,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-917.wav,then the two went off to have some more tea
sample-918.wav,i'll keep you in mind
sample-919.wav,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-920.wav,so what do you want of me the sun asked
sample-921.wav,its easier to endure the cold if you have a warm drink in the belly
sample-922.wav,don't hurt my sore arm again
sample-923.wav,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-924.wav,there were mountains in the distance
sample-925.wav,thomas went to war
sample-926.wav,it's a private club for only the most respectable people
sample-927.wav,that sobered him a little
sample-928.wav,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-929.wav,always ask an objective question
sample-930.wav,why do they need gin
sample-931.wav,all i saw was an army said the boy
sample-932.wav,what do you want here today the desert asked him
sample-933.wav,melissa's phone kept vibrating uncontrollably
sample-934.wav,as they browsed the store together
sample-935.wav,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
sample-936.wav,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-937.wav,during one of these conversations the driver told of his own life
sample-938.wav,gimme the receiving room
sample-939.wav,prefetching is used to avoid cache misses
sample-940.wav,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-941.wav,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-942.wav,raisins are delicious
sample-943.wav,he's out duckshooting now
sample-944.wav,then she filled her vessel with water and left
sample-945.wav,naturally we have to do something about it
sample-946.wav,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-947.wav,but nowhere could he find his new companion
sample-948.wav,and he decided he would go to see the chiefs of the tribes
sample-949.wav,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
sample-950.wav,her apartment is on the rd floor
sample-951.wav,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
sample-952.wav,brenda peters just escaped from the county jail
sample-953.wav,she just stepped out
sample-954.wav,the tradition teaches men how to cross the desert and how their children should marry
sample-955.wav,he dressed in his arabian clothing of white linen bought especially for this day
sample-956.wav,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-957.wav,it's like the flight of those two hawks it can't be understood by reason alone
sample-958.wav,many of them had been right about what they said while some had been wrong
sample-959.wav,have a good trip
sample-960.wav,suddenly there is so much more time in a day because she no longer has to spend hours commuting
sample-961.wav,you've been doing mighty good work lately
sample-962.wav,are you trying to scoop us or something
sample-963.wav,i should say not
sample-964.wav,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
sample-965.wav,you already know all you need to know
sample-966.wav,henderson was taking it in
sample-967.wav,something just flew by
sample-968.wav,the boy fell to the sand nearly unconscious
sample-969.wav,they was both too smart for us
sample-970.wav,my shampoo is made from coconut and sweet almond
sample-971.wav,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-972.wav,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-973.wav,most of my friends have already finished college
sample-974.wav,cables need insulation to prevent short circuits
sample-975.wav,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
sample-976.wav,somehow the paragraphs blurred into each other
sample-977.wav,what's so depressing about that
sample-978.wav,happy new year to you all
sample-979.wav,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-980.wav,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
sample-981.wav,i hate to think what he'll say
sample-982.wav,these figures of wax look creepy
sample-983.wav,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-984.wav,he was able to get on his knees but he quickly slipped back
sample-985.wav,the method does not have to be the best
sample-986.wav,i'm surprised you didn't run into her
sample-987.wav,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-988.wav,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
sample-989.wav,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-990.wav,the space was spartan almost bare
sample-991.wav,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
sample-992.wav,i told you homeboy smuggling is being prosecuted
sample-993.wav,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
sample-994.wav,those are the rules of war the leader explained
sample-995.wav,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-996.wav,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
sample-997.wav,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
sample-998.wav,so many people on the subway are wearing black workout clothes
sample-999.wav,it means only that the heart does what it can the alchemist said
sample-1.wav,the sun began its departure as well
sample-11.wav,when the pan had cooled the monk and the boy looked at it dazzled
sample-12.wav,its lower end was still embedded
sample-13.wav,the boss sent me over with it
sample-14.wav,that's all you are
sample-15.wav,it was the time of day when all of spain slept during the summer
sample-16.wav,is it a deal
sample-17.wav,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-18.wav,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-19.wav,don't mind the colonel
sample-1010.wav,you've been doing mighty good work lately
sample-1011.wav,you got plenty of money
sample-1012.wav,the boy wanted to take her hand
sample-1013.wav,did she guarantee this place
sample-1014.wav,how can i ever face him
sample-1015.wav,he had surprised himself with the thought
sample-1016.wav,and don't forget to make him wear his raincoat in london
sample-1017.wav,the boy looked out at the horizon
sample-1018.wav,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
sample-1019.wav,just get me home
sample-1020.wav,but i was also stumbling because i couldnt look away from these things
sample-1021.wav,i noticed that the boy answered
sample-1022.wav,and don't forget the language of omens
sample-1023.wav,why'd you want to save me
sample-1024.wav,but we've never had any real trouble
sample-1025.wav,his heart squeezed as if his chest had suddenly compressed it
sample-1026.wav,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-1027.wav,he was sure the girl would never understand
sample-1028.wav,what do you know about that
sample-1029.wav,every purchase is a vote
sample-1030.wav,i wonder what molly put in those tacos
sample-1031.wav,there's millions of ways
sample-1032.wav,and there were dunes rocks and plants that insisted on living where survival seemed impossible
sample-1033.wav,the lens was heavy but it had an amazing zoom
sample-1034.wav,you said it to me too
sample-1035.wav,he wants me to write down only things that i think about but not things i plan to do
sample-1036.wav,and all's fair in love and war
sample-1037.wav,but no one actually saw her die
sample-1038.wav,the boy was becoming nervous
sample-1039.wav,he moved about invisible but everyone could hear him
sample-1040.wav,i saw him get it
sample-1041.wav,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
sample-1042.wav,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-1043.wav,especially with an election coming up in a few days
sample-1044.wav,the fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard
sample-1045.wav,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-1046.wav,it's a code said the boy a bit disappointed
sample-1047.wav,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
sample-1048.wav,he regretted having spoken to the camel driver about what he had seen in the desert
sample-1049.wav,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
sample-1050.wav,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
sample-1051.wav,we'll save them for seed
sample-1052.wav,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
sample-1053.wav,i'll be right here
sample-1054.wav,he turned on the microphone just as the hen was ready to squawk
sample-1055.wav,the boy began to dig into the dune
sample-1056.wav,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
sample-1057.wav,i say we don't go out any more
sample-1058.wav,ask the owner of that stall how much the sword costs he said to his friend
sample-1059.wav,because its growth hormone runs away from sunlight
sample-1060.wav,lemon trees are not yellow it's just the fruit
sample-1061.wav,never mind those guys
sample-1062.wav,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
sample-1063.wav,i wouldn't be a bit surprised
sample-1064.wav,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-1065.wav,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
sample-1066.wav,in a little while
sample-1067.wav,a while ago i rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy
sample-1068.wav,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-1069.wav,i guess you forgot something
sample-1070.wav,i can't let you have my plane
sample-1071.wav,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-1072.wav,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-1073.wav,i'm not afraid to die
sample-1074.wav,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
sample-1075.wav,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-1076.wav,i don't want to change anything because i don't know how to deal with change
sample-1077.wav,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
sample-1078.wav,you should show that your method improves results
sample-1079.wav,tickets for the broadcast are all gone
sample-1080.wav,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
sample-1081.wav,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-1082.wav,i am in search of that universal language among other things
sample-1083.wav,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-1084.wav,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-1085.wav,if it were he would already have heard of it
sample-1086.wav,i'm going into the desert the man answered turning back to his reading
sample-1087.wav,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-1088.wav,everyone seemed very excited
sample-1089.wav,it's almost as if he had been here and left his mark he thought
sample-1090.wav,there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
sample-1091.wav,the horse reared again raising a cloud of dust
sample-1092.wav,did she discuss it with you
sample-1093.wav,he couldn't have been wrong
sample-1094.wav,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-1095.wav,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-1096.wav,the boy had never even noticed that there was a hole in his pouch
sample-1097.wav,the boy felt a pang in his heart thinking about the merchant's daughter
sample-1098.wav,the wind began to pick up
sample-1099.wav,no one attacks an oasis
sample-11.wav,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-1101.wav,where are they gone
sample-1102.wav,the references are good in the very narrow area of histogram methods
sample-1103.wav,i can't do that
sample-1104.wav,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-1105.wav,it's as much my fault as yours
sample-1106.wav,as nice as blake's
sample-1107.wav,maktub thought the boy
sample-1108.wav,why would a king be talking with a shepherd the boy asked awed and embarrassed
sample-1109.wav,they both spoke the same language
sample-1110.wav,they were looking only for gold his companion answered
sample-1111.wav,it said that the darkest hour of the night came just before the dawn
sample-1112.wav,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-1113.wav,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-1114.wav,you have developed a serious case of pneumonia
sample-1115.wav,i'm sure she'll be all right
sample-1116.wav,you can't take that desk out
sample-1117.wav,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-1118.wav,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-1119.wav,what are you talking about
sample-1120.wav,i didn't know whose it was
sample-1121.wav,not to worry said the alchemist
sample-1122.wav,brent's opening attack on the governor
sample-1123.wav,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-1124.wav,enough said the boy
sample-1125.wav,it's just like any other day as far as i'm concerned
sample-1126.wav,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
sample-1127.wav,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-1128.wav,she looks as though she's going to come to
sample-1129.wav,elizabeth charles is dead
sample-1130.wav,its been a long time since she last read chekhov and because of that she no longer feels like the heroine of her own story
sample-1131.wav,you don't deny that
sample-1132.wav,that he wanted to travel
sample-1133.wav,he was going to miss the place and all the good things he had learned
sample-1134.wav,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-1135.wav,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-1136.wav,the sun thought for a minute
sample-1137.wav,he condemned the commander to death without honor
sample-1138.wav,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-1139.wav,what am i going to say to elvis
sample-1140.wav,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-1141.wav,but they were not there
sample-1142.wav,i'm not going very far the alchemist answered looking straight into the eyes of the horsemen
sample-1143.wav,he understands the forces of nature
sample-1144.wav,after all who doesnt want to overcome new challenges and achieve great heights
sample-1145.wav,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
sample-1146.wav,but horses tire bit by bit
sample-1147.wav,except for the dream
sample-1148.wav,the xylophone would just be a glockenspiel if it wasn't so metal
sample-1149.wav,please don't make me
sample-1150.wav,you jump i jump
sample-1151.wav,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
sample-1152.wav,he didn't want any conversation at this point
sample-1153.wav,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
sample-1154.wav,he's doing it because it's what he wants to do
sample-1155.wav,the boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker
sample-1156.wav,how do you mean
sample-1157.wav,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-1158.wav,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-1159.wav,i didn't come here to have you read my palm he said already regretting having come
sample-1160.wav,when i'm eating that's all i think about
sample-1161.wav,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-1162.wav,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-1163.wav,and he immediately felt peace in his heart
sample-1164.wav,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-1165.wav,have a good time
sample-1166.wav,the one you marry has got to swim rivers for you
sample-1167.wav,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
sample-1168.wav,we rejoiced at the citadel
sample-1169.wav,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-1170.wav,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-1171.wav,what's the matter with you
sample-1172.wav,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-1173.wav,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-1174.wav,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-1175.wav,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-1176.wav,i said good night
sample-1177.wav,people say strange things the boy thought
sample-1178.wav,i suppose i could
sample-1179.wav,two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
sample-1180.wav,the first day passed
sample-1181.wav,where was his horse
sample-1182.wav,meanwhile the old man persisted in his attempt to strike up a conversation
sample-1183.wav,aiding an escaped criminal
sample-1184.wav,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-1185.wav,i saw him get it
sample-1186.wav,they ate in silence
sample-1187.wav,nice to meet you
sample-1188.wav,the end of the cylinder was still as ogilvy and henderson had left it
sample-1189.wav,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-1190.wav,there was no way to measure anything of that length
sample-1191.wav,is it all right
sample-1192.wav,can you see what is beyond the golden birches 
sample-1193.wav,they're starting to throw things
sample-1194.wav,we've done it said the englishman who had also awakened early
sample-1195.wav,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
sample-1196.wav,those are the rules of war the leader explained
sample-1197.wav,it's a man who understands nature and the world
sample-1198.wav,that's all i ask
sample-1199.wav,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-12.wav,the sword didn't fall
sample-1201.wav,it was not clear who had the right of way since the traffic lights were off
sample-1202.wav,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-1203.wav,she knows that men have to go away in order to return
sample-1204.wav,this is from the governor
sample-1205.wav,i'm going to guide you across the desert the alchemist said
sample-1206.wav,now you got me
sample-1207.wav,can i have one of those
sample-1208.wav,from then on the boy understood his heart
sample-1209.wav,the sun began its departure as well
sample-1210.wav,they can't help themselves
sample-1211.wav,everything has been written by the same hand
sample-1212.wav,i've got to get katie out of jail
sample-1213.wav,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-1214.wav,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-1215.wav,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
sample-1216.wav,it seemed he had made the long journey for nothing
sample-1217.wav,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-1218.wav,show me where there is life out in the desert
sample-1219.wav,watch out for his venom the boy said
sample-1220.wav,she never told her that
sample-1221.wav,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-1222.wav,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-1223.wav,the years of research the magic symbols the strange words and the laboratory equipment
sample-1224.wav,but i felt miserable watching him wither away like a shriveled dandelion
sample-1225.wav,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
sample-1226.wav,those are the rules of war the leader explained
sample-1227.wav,why didn't i call you back
sample-1228.wav,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-1229.wav,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-1230.wav,that's right said the old man able to read the boy's thoughts
sample-1231.wav,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-1232.wav,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
sample-1233.wav,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-1234.wav,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-1235.wav,the drivers carried the freight themselves over such treacherous footing and then reloaded the camels
sample-1236.wav,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
sample-1237.wav,he left without saying goodbye to the crystal merchant
sample-1238.wav,but can we trust him
sample-1239.wav,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-1240.wav,our new ai can dynamically adapt the balance of the gameplay
sample-1241.wav,that's never happened to me the boy said
sample-1242.wav,why should i be in any danger
sample-1243.wav,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-1244.wav,four hundred and fifty dollars
sample-1245.wav,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-1246.wav,plastic surgery has become more popular
sample-1247.wav,the crowd on the far left seemed to get bigger and i heard now a faint murmur from it
sample-1248.wav,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-1249.wav,chickens are adorable
sample-1250.wav,christmas is a lot like easter
sample-1251.wav,there was a small building there with a window at which people bought tickets to africa
sample-1252.wav,i'm already used to the way things are
sample-1253.wav,are you a hypnotist
sample-1254.wav,that's what i'd like to know
sample-1255.wav,yours sincerely satan
sample-1256.wav,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-1257.wav,of course i believe you
sample-1258.wav,the boy was shocked
sample-1259.wav,that tina thought it was funny
sample-1260.wav,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
sample-1261.wav,the animals were exhausted and the men talked among themselves less and less
sample-1262.wav,the wind began to blow again
sample-1263.wav,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-1264.wav,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
sample-1265.wav,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-1266.wav,you have helped me the man continued to prepare his tea saying nothing
sample-1267.wav,i've got a weakness
sample-1268.wav,they both spoke the same language
sample-1269.wav,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-1270.wav,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-1271.wav,he didn't want any conversation at this point
sample-1272.wav,everyone seemed very excited
sample-1273.wav,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-1274.wav,they called that discovery the master work  it was part liquid and part solid
sample-1275.wav,the arab accepted them without a word
sample-1276.wav,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-1277.wav,as he was leaving he saw in the corner of the room his old shepherd's pouch
sample-1278.wav,that's what alchemists do
sample-1279.wav,the quicker the better
sample-1280.wav,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
sample-1281.wav,he restarted his efforts for the twentieth time
sample-1282.wav,she gave them each a half to make them work together
sample-1283.wav,who gets your vote
sample-1284.wav,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-1285.wav,it was sprayed in red with yellow edges
sample-1286.wav,all they think about is food and water
sample-1287.wav,we'll find you a hotel
sample-1288.wav,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-1289.wav,the treasure is at the pyramids that you already knew
sample-1290.wav,there was very little talking
sample-1291.wav,it must be some kind of a gag
sample-1292.wav,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-1293.wav,i know she writes them
sample-1294.wav,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-1295.wav,it would kill you
sample-1296.wav,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
sample-1297.wav,you're in luck you two the fat arab said
sample-1298.wav,it was a bundle of money
sample-1299.wav,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-13.wav,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-1301.wav,he had never even wept in front of his own sheep
sample-1302.wav,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-1303.wav,by the light of their own destruction i saw them staggering and falling and their supporters turning to run
sample-1304.wav,but don't worry the alchemist continued
sample-1305.wav,then taking his sheep he walked away
sample-1306.wav,before the boy could reply a butterfly appeared and fluttered between him and the old man
sample-1307.wav,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-1308.wav,it was early morning when she woke up
sample-1309.wav,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-1310.wav,you'll get your money in sixty days
sample-1311.wav,he was planning as he left the bar
sample-1312.wav,it was a pleasant change from talking to his sheep
sample-1313.wav,no he heard a voice on the wind say
sample-1314.wav,patrick has terminal cancer
sample-1315.wav,the shop is exactly the size i always wanted it to be
sample-1316.wav,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-1317.wav,what is the benefit of the method in terms of identification accuracy
sample-1318.wav,there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
sample-1319.wav,i had never heard of alchemists before the boy said
sample-1320.wav,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-1321.wav,a boy came running towards me
sample-1322.wav,he drew on the back of his jacket with a blue fountain pen
sample-1323.wav,there were thirty girls on the soccer field
sample-1324.wav,that's got nothing to do with it
sample-1325.wav,everything you need to know you have learned through your journey
sample-1326.wav,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
sample-1327.wav,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-1328.wav,i could eat a horse
sample-1329.wav,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-1330.wav,we need to run
sample-1331.wav,i told you to practice
sample-1332.wav,on the first day he returned with a rabbit and on the second with two birds
sample-1333.wav,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-1334.wav,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-1335.wav,it was the pure language of the world
sample-1336.wav,another trick the boy thought
sample-1337.wav,so he could not be hasty nor impatient
sample-1338.wav,you will never be able to escape from your heart
sample-1339.wav,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-1340.wav,he took back his books and packed them away again in their bags
sample-1341.wav,you've got just ten minutes
sample-1342.wav,that song reminds me of my childhood
sample-1343.wav,the little group of people from the city dispersed
sample-1344.wav,two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
sample-1345.wav,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
sample-1346.wav,when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
sample-1347.wav,it's the master work of the alchemists
sample-1348.wav,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
sample-1349.wav,but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
sample-1350.wav,the boy brought his horse closer
sample-1351.wav,fatima appeared at the entrance to the tent
sample-1352.wav,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-1353.wav,but they were not there
sample-1354.wav,have you notified the police
sample-1355.wav,i know what you're feeling
sample-1356.wav,ten minutes for what
sample-1357.wav,whom are you calling now
sample-1358.wav,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
sample-1359.wav,his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
sample-1360.wav,who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
sample-1361.wav,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
sample-1362.wav,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-1363.wav,they rode for the entire day
sample-1364.wav,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
sample-1365.wav,i was sent down here to clean house
sample-1366.wav,he wanted your money he said
sample-1367.wav,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-1368.wav,i think we were wrong about sally having the money
sample-1369.wav,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-1370.wav,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-1371.wav,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
sample-1372.wav,a boy came running towards me
sample-1373.wav,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
sample-1374.wav,how much is it worth
sample-1375.wav,i'll just watch him he said to himself
sample-1376.wav,i'm going to hate those who have found their treasure because i never found mine
sample-1377.wav,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-1378.wav,and one or two persons were returning
sample-1379.wav,i thought that was peter parker
sample-1380.wav,but everything had changed
sample-1381.wav,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-1382.wav,yeah its definitely worth checking out especially if the pay is reasonable and the work is good for your career there was absolutely no reason for her to announce it to the entire company
sample-1383.wav,i could see something in their faces
sample-1384.wav,no one said a word as the old man continued
sample-1385.wav,have you got that money
sample-1386.wav,a breeze began to blow
sample-1387.wav,the clock was slightly askew
sample-1388.wav,here's two thousand dollars
sample-1389.wav,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-1390.wav,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-1391.wav,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-1392.wav,she's written to me every day since
sample-1393.wav,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-1394.wav,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-1395.wav,let's go and have some lunch said the crystal merchant
sample-1396.wav,i've had this shop for thirty years
sample-1397.wav,there was a murmur from the crowd
sample-1398.wav,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-1399.wav,the boy's heart began to speak of fear
sample-14.wav,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-1401.wav,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-1402.wav,maybe that's why they always stay close to me
sample-1403.wav,who you holding out on
sample-1404.wav,don't worry i took a cab to get home safely
sample-1405.wav,my dog is an alsatian we call her 'poppy'
sample-1406.wav,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
sample-1407.wav,you'll use your knowledge for the welfare of the oasis and its inhabitants
sample-1408.wav,that sobered him a little
sample-1409.wav,i think its too overwhelming to introduce two complex tools that basically do the same things
sample-1410.wav,you've got the mayor and pullman backed against a wall
sample-1411.wav,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-1412.wav,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-1413.wav,what's in that desk
sample-1414.wav,so he asked if the old man's blessing was still with him
sample-1415.wav,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
sample-1416.wav,but the boy couldn't even speak
sample-1417.wav,it seemed he had made the long journey for nothing
sample-1418.wav,will you get out and let me handle this
sample-1419.wav,our deadline is coming up rapidly and we will need help
sample-1420.wav,but the tradition also says that we should believe the messages of the desert
sample-1421.wav,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-1422.wav,at the highest point in tarifa there is an old fort built by the moors
sample-1423.wav,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
sample-1424.wav,on the  o'clock train
sample-1425.wav,they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
sample-1426.wav,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-1427.wav,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-1428.wav,but he granted the travelers three days
sample-1429.wav,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-1430.wav,whose turn is it
sample-1431.wav,hires two personal trainers and make one of them train the other one
sample-1432.wav,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
sample-1433.wav,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-1434.wav,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-1435.wav,you'll find us everywhere
sample-1436.wav,it was the pure language of the world
sample-1437.wav,the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
sample-1438.wav,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-1439.wav,don't ask me why i don't know why
sample-1440.wav,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-1441.wav,learn to recognize omens and follow them the old king had said
sample-1442.wav,everyone seemed very excited
sample-1443.wav,perhaps she met somebody
sample-1444.wav,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-1445.wav,the shepherd swore that he would
sample-1446.wav,that life may always have flavor
sample-1447.wav,not even the tribal chieftains are able to see him when they want to
sample-1448.wav,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-1449.wav,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-1450.wav,we need to hurry
sample-1451.wav,it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
sample-1452.wav,he wanted to forget about the vision and return to his meditation
sample-1453.wav,a thin circle of bright metal showed between the top and the body of the cylinder
sample-1454.wav,it's going to take a while the boy said
sample-1455.wav,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-1456.wav,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
sample-1457.wav,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
sample-1458.wav,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-1459.wav,first they tried to find him on their own
sample-1460.wav,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
sample-1461.wav,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
sample-1462.wav,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-1463.wav,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-1464.wav,we should segregate the participants by age
sample-1465.wav,then we can climb mt helen
sample-1466.wav,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-1467.wav,he wandered for a while keeping the date palms of the oasis within sight
sample-1468.wav,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
sample-1469.wav,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-1470.wav,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
sample-1471.wav,the war continued and at times the wind carried the sweet sickly smell of blood
sample-1472.wav,i told him we could teach her to ignore people who waste her time
sample-1473.wav,to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
sample-1474.wav,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
sample-1475.wav,we've got to produce a show now
sample-1476.wav,yes or even search for treasure
sample-1477.wav,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-1478.wav,and he hadn't perceived them because he had become accustomed to them
sample-1479.wav,then i don't get paid
sample-1480.wav,she accused an exconvict of stalking and sexual assault
sample-1481.wav,then i've only got an hour to dress
sample-1482.wav,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-1483.wav,if you have to wait until the war is over then wait
sample-1484.wav,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
sample-1485.wav,the pilots braced themselves for impact
sample-1486.wav,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-1487.wav,the men of the desert were already familiar with that wind
sample-1488.wav,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-1489.wav,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-1490.wav,how do you like her
sample-1491.wav,a sight for sore eyes
sample-1492.wav,the merchant was silent for a few moments
sample-1493.wav,i'll give it a drink
sample-1494.wav,how long is what
sample-1495.wav,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-1496.wav,the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
sample-1497.wav,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-1498.wav,remember the interview i wrote with alice wellman
sample-1499.wav,how do you mean
sample-15.wav,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-1501.wav,i'll be right back
sample-1502.wav,for your first installation i highly recommend using their prepackaged version of python to avoid trouble
sample-1503.wav,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-1504.wav,take that fire extinguisher and put out the fire
sample-1505.wav,others stumbled upon the stone by accident
sample-1506.wav,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-1507.wav,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-1508.wav,stick to your clubs
sample-1509.wav,my friend bought all the other sheep immediately
sample-1510.wav,last time i made the mistake of replicating a drawing by rodin
sample-1511.wav,taking the jacket out he began to clean the glasses
sample-1512.wav,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
sample-1513.wav,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-1514.wav,the shirt off my back
sample-1515.wav,the desert with its endless monotony put him to dreaming
sample-1516.wav,it's a beautiful miracle
sample-1517.wav,she looks kind of bored
sample-1518.wav,she's a feisty little ferret
sample-1519.wav,it's the name of the prophet's daughter fatima said
sample-1520.wav,the terrorist group made their demand
sample-1521.wav,but they were not there
sample-1522.wav,and so do i
sample-1523.wav,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-1524.wav,he expertly gutted the rabbit
sample-1525.wav,as they began to decorate the hallway a silhouette appeared in the doorway
sample-1526.wav,when did you arrive in town
sample-1527.wav,an important difference is the amount of experiences that is to say inputs
sample-1528.wav,because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-1529.wav,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-1530.wav,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-1531.wav,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-1532.wav,so when i look out over your sands i am also looking at her
sample-1533.wav,would you like a cappuccino
sample-1534.wav,do you think steven would have let you keep it
sample-1535.wav,but a lovely chap
sample-1536.wav,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-1537.wav,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-1538.wav,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
sample-1539.wav,tomorrow at this same time bring me a tenth of your flock
sample-1540.wav,i can see that
sample-1541.wav,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-1542.wav,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-1543.wav,class was dismissed due to a freak incident caused by a chemical spill
sample-1544.wav,it was difficult not to think about what he had left behind
sample-1545.wav,my review of the sun one star
sample-1546.wav,it didn't even occur to the boy to flee
sample-1547.wav,but she is gone
sample-1548.wav,i don't believe it
sample-1549.wav,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-1550.wav,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-1551.wav,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
sample-1552.wav,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-1553.wav,its lower end was still embedded
sample-1554.wav,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-1555.wav,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-1556.wav,i guess i used all the shells
sample-1557.wav,they can't do that to me
sample-1558.wav,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-1559.wav,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
sample-1560.wav,he disappeared into the tent
sample-1561.wav,how would you like to work for me
sample-1562.wav,this was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered
sample-1563.wav,later we simply let life proceed in its own direction toward its own fate
sample-1564.wav,a pile of soft ashes coated her body and filled her nostrils
sample-1565.wav,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-1566.wav,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-1567.wav,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-1568.wav,people said that gypsies spent their lives tricking others
sample-1569.wav,he wanted to tell him about fatima
sample-1570.wav,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-1571.wav,as they sat down at the only table in the place the crystal merchant laughed
sample-1572.wav,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-1573.wav,if you start your emails with greetings let me be the first to welcome you to earth
sample-1574.wav,maktub thought the boy
sample-1575.wav,i'm terribly sorry she isn't here
sample-1576.wav,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-1577.wav,i'm observing passiveaggressive behavior the psychologist said in a professional tone
sample-1578.wav,the camel driver understood what the boy was saying
sample-1579.wav,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-1580.wav,that's the man who knows all the secrets of the world she said
sample-1581.wav,how do people celebrate good weather over there
sample-1582.wav,i just got rid of one crowd
sample-1583.wav,and i will tell you how to find the hidden treasure
sample-1584.wav,they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
sample-1585.wav,thanks for the clarification
sample-1586.wav,fatima was more important than his treasure
sample-1587.wav,and because the tribes declared war i went to the well seeking the alchemist
sample-1588.wav,when the simum ceased to blow everyone looked to the place where the boy had been
sample-1589.wav,the boy looked out at the horizon
sample-1590.wav,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-1591.wav,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-1592.wav,they raised their glasses in the old bar
sample-1593.wav,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-1594.wav,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
sample-1595.wav,the report was largely scathing
sample-1596.wav,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-1597.wav,that's the best part of it
sample-1598.wav,i tore him apart
sample-1599.wav,some of our biggest clients are affected
sample-16.wav,i'm going to them

sample-1603.wav,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-1604.wav,so the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand
sample-1605.wav,listen to that mob
sample-1606.wav,can i help you
sample-1607.wav,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-1608.wav,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-1609.wav,well he thought about that the old man said
sample-1610.wav,but the crystal merchant had no choice
sample-1611.wav,they ate in silence
sample-1612.wav,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-1613.wav,he asked it please never to stop speaking to him
sample-1614.wav,the wind began to pick up
sample-1615.wav,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
sample-1616.wav,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-1617.wav,and he wasn't faring much better
sample-1618.wav,did you learn anything the englishman asked eager to hear what it might be
sample-1619.wav,the sweet corn tasted better grilled
sample-1620.wav,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-1621.wav,instead the stranger lowered it slowly until the point touched the boy's forehead
sample-1622.wav,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-1623.wav,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-1624.wav,before he gets through tonight he'll ruin us all
sample-1625.wav,should i understand the emerald tablet the boy asked
sample-1626.wav,wait till those two future jailbirds read the morning post tomorrow
sample-1627.wav,then the two went off to have some more tea
sample-1628.wav,she needs to get her transcripts and passport first
sample-1629.wav,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-1630.wav,the serpent relaxed immediately
sample-1631.wav,i can clean up those glasses in the window if you want said the boy
sample-1632.wav,he thought of the woman who had trusted in the desert
sample-1633.wav,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-1634.wav,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
sample-1635.wav,a while ago i rode through the desert with a man who had books on alchemy
sample-1636.wav,he slipped on the stairs
sample-1637.wav,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-1638.wav,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-1639.wav,it was the most delicious wine he had ever tasted
sample-1640.wav,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-1641.wav,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
sample-1642.wav,i was torn between fear and curiosity
sample-1643.wav,his soul must be too primitive to understand those things he thought
sample-1644.wav,what do you know about miranda
sample-1645.wav,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
sample-1646.wav,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features

sample-1648.wav,where your treasure is there also will be your heart the alchemist had told him
sample-1649.wav,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-1650.wav,then who are you
sample-1651.wav,he appeared with the first stars of evening
sample-1652.wav,i haven't any hard feelings
sample-1653.wav,they seemed to laugh at him and he laughed back his heart bursting with joy
sample-1654.wav,have trusted more in your love for fatima
sample-1655.wav,when were these books written the boy asked
sample-1656.wav,they're always after me for interviews
sample-1657.wav,not that i was listening but i noticed that you sounded really stressed when you were explaining the situation to him
sample-1658.wav,what is a foreigner doing here asked another of the men
sample-1659.wav,but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
sample-1660.wav,because life wants you to achieve your destiny

sample-1673.wav,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-1674.wav,we've got to do something
sample-1675.wav,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-1676.wav,they filled three sacks
sample-1677.wav,the desert didn't answer him for a few moments
sample-1678.wav,next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al fayoum
sample-1679.wav,and he asked the boy if he too were in search of the alchemist
sample-1680.wav,only in that way would he be able to read the omens
sample-1681.wav,one that will write
sample-1682.wav,from here on you will be alone the alchemist said
sample-1683.wav,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-1684.wav,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-1685.wav,every day was there to be lived or to mark one's departure from this world

sample-1693.wav,that was the law of hospitality
sample-1694.wav,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-1695.wav,but she said nothing
sample-1696.wav,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-1697.wav,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle

sample-1699.wav,they'll take care of it
sample-17.wav,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer

sample-1703.wav,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-1704.wav,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
sample-1705.wav,the ceiling collapsed inwards

sample-1716.wav,the old man said nothing
sample-1717.wav,it's even higher than this
sample-1718.wav,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
sample-1719.wav,i'm afraid it is important
sample-1720.wav,nobody's trying to steal from you
sample-1721.wav,i want to tell you a story about dreams said the alchemist
sample-1722.wav,the old man looked disappointed
sample-1723.wav,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-1724.wav,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-1725.wav,the boy began to dig into the dune
sample-1726.wav,neighbors moved away and there remained only a few small shops on the hill
sample-1727.wav,the same book that taught me about urim and thummim
sample-1728.wav,eventually the merchant had to hire two more employees
sample-1729.wav,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
sample-1730.wav,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-1731.wav,but he kept quiet because he had heard what the alchemist said to the monk
sample-1732.wav,dont share your opinions so readily because you never know who is listening
sample-1733.wav,so you got married
sample-1734.wav,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed

sample-1738.wav,i'm going with you the boy said
sample-1739.wav,its too early to tell whether the strategy will pay off
sample-1740.wav,just by looking at them
sample-1741.wav,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-1742.wav,he saw the boy appear from the other side of the dunes
sample-1743.wav,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-1744.wav,and one or two persons were returning
sample-1745.wav,he could always become a crystal salesman again
sample-1746.wav,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-1747.wav,the boy offered his bottle hoping that the old man would leave him alone

sample-1763.wav,but in his heart he knew that it did matter
sample-1764.wav,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-1765.wav,the men were terrified at his sorcery
sample-1766.wav,life attracts life the alchemist answered
sample-1767.wav,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded

sample-1984.wav,the big guy there
sample-1985.wav,of course you wouldn't know

sample-1999.wav,i dont understand why you use the negative gradient
sample-2.wav,the runway seems way too short for this type of plane
sample-21.wav,you have been a real blessing to me
sample-22.wav,i still have no idea how to turn myself into the wind the boy repeated
sample-23.wav,i know its dimensions and how it behaves
sample-24.wav,enough said the boy
sample-25.wav,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-26.wav,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-27.wav,there was hardly any movement from the pit
sample-28.wav,this was my destiny not yours the alchemist answered
sample-29.wav,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-2010.wav,ann is very much interested
sample-2011.wav,he had come to the town only to find a woman who could interpret his dream
sample-2012.wav,the boy had noticed that the englishman was irritable and missed his books
sample-2013.wav,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-2014.wav,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-2015.wav,how much do you make a week
sample-2016.wav,i'll give it a drink
sample-2017.wav,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-2018.wav,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-2019.wav,maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
sample-2020.wav,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
sample-2021.wav,they were strange books
sample-2022.wav,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed

sample-2026.wav,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-2027.wav,spotted dick is a classic british pudding

sample-2029.wav,you ought to stay over
sample-2030.wav,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-2031.wav,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-2032.wav,then you'll die in the midst of trying to realize your destiny
sample-2033.wav,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-2034.wav,he sat looking at the sky for a long time
sample-2035.wav,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-2036.wav,all things are one the boy thought
sample-2037.wav,who are you he heard a voice ask him in spanish
sample-2038.wav,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-2039.wav,i just saw the sheriff
sample-2040.wav,and a glass of milk
sample-2041.wav,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-2042.wav,they were on the right track
sample-2043.wav,that gives you an idea of what i'm up against
sample-2044.wav,they were both silent for a time observing the plaza and the townspeople
sample-2045.wav,when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
sample-2046.wav,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-2047.wav,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-2048.wav,you're going to run into the governor
sample-2049.wav,i don't know how to explain it
sample-2050.wav,plastic surgery has become more popular
sample-2051.wav,suddenly he disappeared and i could hear a faint shriek behind the walls
sample-2052.wav,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
sample-2053.wav,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-2054.wav,however the authors ignore a very large body of work on tone mapping
sample-2055.wav,he knew he was stronger than his friend
sample-2056.wav,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-2057.wav,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-2058.wav,i own my own house
sample-2059.wav,i always have been
sample-2060.wav,want to walk to new york
sample-2061.wav,i've had this shop for thirty years
sample-2062.wav,and find out where the nearest telegraph office is
sample-2063.wav,so his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon
sample-2064.wav,what he said reminded the boy of the old king
sample-2065.wav,is that screwball pitpat still around
sample-2066.wav,the wind told me that you know about love the boy said to the sun
sample-2067.wav,the atmosphere was suffused with the sweet scent of smoke
sample-2068.wav,the city sealer's office
sample-2069.wav,even when all you want to do is travel
sample-2070.wav,turning off gadgets that are not in use can save a lot of energy
sample-2071.wav,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-2072.wav,well why don't you go to mecca now asked the boy
sample-2073.wav,you wanna take this outside
sample-2074.wav,did you get the mayor
sample-2075.wav,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-2076.wav,you wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town
sample-2077.wav,but can we trust him
sample-2078.wav,i'll show those guys
sample-2079.wav,he wrapped the twigs in a piece of cloth and put them back in his bag
sample-2080.wav,he knelt down to find urim and thummim and put them back in the pouch
sample-2081.wav,let's go hiking across france
sample-2082.wav,he still calls his mother 'mummy'
sample-2083.wav,watch out blues ahead
sample-2084.wav,no one can compare to your results
sample-2085.wav,i can explain if you'll just listen
sample-2086.wav,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
sample-2087.wav,let's stop this another commander said
sample-2088.wav,i'm not taking any more chances
sample-2089.wav,it brought his heart into his mouth
sample-2090.wav,you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you
sample-2091.wav,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-2092.wav,now i will drift gently off to dreamland
sample-2093.wav,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
sample-2094.wav,the lead had dried into the shape of the pan but it was no longer lead
sample-2095.wav,the boy took them to the cliff where he had been on the previous day
sample-2096.wav,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-2097.wav,you should show that your method improves results
sample-2098.wav,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
sample-2099.wav,i've never had one before the merchant answered
sample-21.wav,still can't contact conway
sample-2101.wav,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-2102.wav,i didn't want the publicity
sample-2103.wav,i didn't even ask him
sample-2104.wav,the boy was astonished by what he saw inside
sample-2105.wav,he was sure the girl would never understand
sample-2106.wav,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-2107.wav,it's a good thing i got here in time
sample-2108.wav,as soon as he saw me among the crowd he called to me to come down
sample-2109.wav,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-2110.wav,she couldn't find a waste basket
sample-2111.wav,suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
sample-2112.wav,they were always just somebody to fill up the bleachers
sample-2113.wav,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-2114.wav,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-2115.wav,and finally the falcon returned with their meal
sample-2116.wav,this recording is corrupted
sample-2117.wav,he was more certain of it than of anything in the world
sample-2118.wav,so what is salem like he asked trying to get some sort of clue
sample-2119.wav,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-2120.wav,the idea frightened him
sample-2121.wav,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-2122.wav,the englishman had several suitcases filled with books
sample-2123.wav,you're just the one i wanted to see
sample-2124.wav,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-2125.wav,that's why burns is here
sample-2126.wav,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-2127.wav,it means my job
sample-2128.wav,he remembered something his grandfather had once told him that butterflies were a good omen
sample-2129.wav,what do you mean by that
sample-2130.wav,the girls didnt know who to trust so they ran fast
sample-2131.wav,i'm going with you the boy said
sample-2132.wav,please don't appeal to my sentimental side
sample-2133.wav,he remembered what the old man had said about offering something you didn't even have yet
sample-2134.wav,anthony kept himself busy by counting pigeons
sample-2135.wav,with the girl with the raven hair his days would never be the same again
sample-2136.wav,get out of here
sample-2137.wav,the only tribesman spared was the commander of the battalion
sample-2138.wav,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-2139.wav,the internet of uncontrolled things brought us a distributed denial of service attack once again
sample-2140.wav,and the odor of the animals became a bit more tolerable
sample-2141.wav,the boy remembered his dream and suddenly everything was clear to him
sample-2142.wav,and shouldn't they be garnished
sample-2143.wav,this is the mayor
sample-2144.wav,crossing your own pals
sample-2145.wav,by letting me help you
sample-2146.wav,they'll never close us up today
sample-2147.wav,the meeting was over
sample-2148.wav,i had it served with my breakfast this morning
sample-2149.wav,first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
sample-2150.wav,i could have helped her
sample-2151.wav,after two hours he returned to the room where the wise man was
sample-2152.wav,the boy didn't say anything
sample-2153.wav,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-2154.wav,because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-2155.wav,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-2156.wav,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
sample-2157.wav,drunken elks are very dangerous be aware
sample-2158.wav,i need some time to think
sample-2159.wav,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-2160.wav,he sat on a stone and allowed himself to become hypnotized by the horizon
sample-2161.wav,our mortgage is in arrears
sample-2162.wav,the sword didn't fall
sample-2163.wav,the boy promised himself that when he returned from egypt he would buy that sword
sample-2164.wav,the alchemist erased the circle in the sand and the snake slithered away among the rocks
sample-2165.wav,give me my book the boy said
sample-2166.wav,mars is almost uninhabitable
sample-2167.wav,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-2168.wav,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-2169.wav,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
sample-2170.wav,the boy approached her to ask about the alchemist
sample-2171.wav,nature knows me as the wisest being in creation the sun said
sample-2172.wav,one of us is going to jail
sample-2173.wav,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-2174.wav,it's a commentary on what we laughingly call the civilized world
sample-2175.wav,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-2176.wav,and i'd better read your books said the boy
sample-2177.wav,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-2178.wav,i dont mind working from home most of the time but i do miss having coworkers
sample-2179.wav,a practice of infidels he said to himself
sample-2180.wav,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
sample-2181.wav,i want those stamps
sample-2182.wav,there was no way for everybody to know about alchemy
sample-2183.wav,the wind's curiosity was aroused something that had never happened before
sample-2184.wav,next morning there were two thousand armed men scattered throughout the palm trees at al fayoum
sample-2185.wav,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-2186.wav,the guy thought he was a lunatic at large and made an unsuccessful attempt to stop him
sample-2187.wav,there is a way out
sample-2188.wav,the sun began its departure as well
sample-2189.wav,the tribal chieftain called for the boy and presented him with fifty pieces of gold
sample-2190.wav,you don't have to be rich skinny popular or even own a cape to perform a random act of kindness
sample-2191.wav,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-2192.wav,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-2193.wav,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-2194.wav,there's life here the boy said to the alchemist
sample-2195.wav,i have to find a man who knows that universal language
sample-2196.wav,the boy thought of fatima
sample-2197.wav,and the alchemist understood that the boy's heart had returned to the soul of the world
sample-2198.wav,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-2199.wav,someone set fire to the trash
sample-22.wav,they'd never let you go
sample-2201.wav,in one he had read that many years ago a famous arabian alchemist had visited europe
sample-2202.wav,the caravan moved toward the east
sample-2203.wav,what a wonderful weather
sample-2204.wav,before guns were invented armies had to throw bullets at each other and if a bullet touched you you had to sit out until the next war
sample-2205.wav,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-2206.wav,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-2207.wav,how about that one there
sample-2208.wav,wait till those two future jailbirds read the morning post tomorrow
sample-2209.wav,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
sample-2210.wav,breakfast is usually earlier than this she thought
sample-2211.wav,know what my old man did when i joined up
sample-2212.wav,i got two giant bug bites on my right leg from last night and they hurt
sample-2213.wav,wait a minute
sample-2214.wav,he wanted to say so to the alchemist but he was afraid of the man
sample-2215.wav,the two walked out among the palms
sample-2216.wav,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-2217.wav,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-2218.wav,mozzarella is a creamy cheese that goes well with tomato and basil
sample-2219.wav,he's the man the ads are written for
sample-2220.wav,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-2221.wav,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-2222.wav,he must be disguised to avoid encounters with thieves
sample-2223.wav,the desert was all sand in some stretches and rocky in others
sample-2224.wav,am i talking too much
sample-2225.wav,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-2226.wav,the camel driver was not a fighter and he had consulted with seers
sample-2227.wav,i don't blame them
sample-2228.wav,mary told me that she got to meet up with you while she was back in san francisco
sample-2229.wav,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
sample-2230.wav,apologies for not calling you back
sample-2231.wav,it took him a while to get to the office
sample-2232.wav,the swat entry team used an optical wand to observe the proceedings behind the door
sample-2233.wav,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-2234.wav,i just know that the tradition is always right
sample-2235.wav,that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
sample-2236.wav,but the king of salem hoped desperately that the boy would be successful
sample-2237.wav,he called to the boy and they took a walk along the dunes surrounding the encampment
sample-2238.wav,i learned the alchemist's secrets in my travels
sample-2239.wav,the stranger continued to hold the sword at the boy's forehead
sample-2240.wav,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-2241.wav,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-2242.wav,if i could i'd write a huge encyclopedia just about the words luck and coincidence
sample-2243.wav,when i'm eating that's all i think about
sample-2244.wav,he also tried to remember some good stories to relate as he sheared the sheep
sample-2245.wav,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-2246.wav,for every ten dead men among our enemies you will receive a piece of gold
sample-2247.wav,and the sand and gravel had been flung violently in every direction
sample-2248.wav,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-2249.wav,i want to live again
sample-2250.wav,the serpent relaxed immediately
sample-2251.wav,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
sample-2252.wav,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
sample-2253.wav,it's the oasis said the camel driver
sample-2254.wav,this wedge prevents the trailer from rolling down the slope in case of brake failure
sample-2255.wav,who is this stranger who speaks of omens asked one of the chieftains eyeing the boy
sample-2256.wav,better get a pencil out and write it down
sample-2257.wav,the horse galloped uncontrollably
sample-2258.wav,isn't it just beautiful
sample-2259.wav,you knew the whole story
sample-2260.wav,the camel driver though seemed not to be very concerned with the threat of war
sample-2261.wav,we must get some of that serum as soon as possible
sample-2262.wav,no more tickets left
sample-2263.wav,i'll be a monkey's uncle
sample-2264.wav,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-2265.wav,unfortunately nobody can warrant the sanctions that will have an effect on the community
sample-2266.wav,never mind the european war
sample-2267.wav,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-2268.wav,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-2269.wav,but he had to move on
sample-2270.wav,the sun thought about that and decided to shine more brightly
sample-2271.wav,mind if i sit down
sample-2272.wav,that's true the boy thought
sample-2273.wav,this man looked exactly the same except that now the roles were reversed
sample-2274.wav,but that was simply because my eye was tired
sample-2275.wav,artisanal gin bar seriously
sample-2276.wav,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-2277.wav,you mustn't let what she said bother you
sample-2278.wav,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-2279.wav,we miss you and miss having a friend like you and i am so happy that you two got to catch up
sample-2280.wav,once again he was experiencing the language without words
sample-2281.wav,to realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation
sample-2282.wav,maybe we'd better ask someone the boy suggested
sample-2283.wav,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-2284.wav,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-2285.wav,my wife pointed out to me the brightness of the red green and yellow signal lights
sample-2286.wav,the omens had been true after all
sample-2287.wav,you weren't here to build them
sample-2288.wav,it was his heart that would tell him where his treasure was hidden
sample-2289.wav,you should read the new book mark twain's writing now
sample-2290.wav,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
sample-2291.wav,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
sample-2292.wav,the one you're blocking
sample-2293.wav,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-2294.wav,i feel like a bootlegger
sample-2295.wav,there's no danger the boy said when they had moved on past the encampment
sample-2296.wav,your mother and i talked it over half the night
sample-2297.wav,image registration and invariant representations could both be done in a computationally very efficient way
sample-2298.wav,but she said nothing
sample-2299.wav,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-23.wav,he can't hurt anybody
sample-2301.wav,the boy accustomed to recognizing omens spoke to the merchant
sample-2302.wav,you'll be the counselor of the oasis
sample-2303.wav,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-2304.wav,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-2305.wav,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-2306.wav,the englishman said nothing
sample-2307.wav,the falcon's beak carries bits of me myself the desert said
sample-2308.wav,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-2309.wav,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-2310.wav,i promised that i would make my own decisions he said to himself
sample-2311.wav,everyone seemed very excited
sample-2312.wav,i find the other argument dubious
sample-2313.wav,peertopeer networks are more robust than clientserver architectures
sample-2314.wav,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
sample-2315.wav,come in again some time
sample-2316.wav,they began to ride out over the sands with the moon lighting their way
sample-2317.wav,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-2318.wav,an army is coming the boy said
sample-2319.wav,the old man wore a breastplate of gold and he knew about my past
sample-2320.wav,then she again took his hands and studied them carefully
sample-2321.wav,i imagine this will be a surprise to some people
sample-2322.wav,suddenly the elder at the center smiled almost imperceptibly and the boy felt better
sample-2323.wav,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
sample-2324.wav,don't sit there like a frozen robin
sample-2325.wav,had our instruments permitted it we might have been able to see the trouble way back when
sample-2326.wav,joshua regretted buying a cheap air conditioner now that it was warmer
sample-2327.wav,the next day he gave his son a pouch that held three ancient spanish gold coins
sample-2328.wav,i have no information about troops or about the movement of the tribes
sample-2329.wav,there was very little talking
sample-2330.wav,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
sample-2331.wav,but he knew that salem wasn't in andalusia
sample-2332.wav,it was starlight and i explained the signs of the zodiac to her
sample-2333.wav,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-2334.wav,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
sample-2335.wav,i understand sheep they're no longer a problem and they can be good friends
sample-2336.wav,to nourish the falcon
sample-2337.wav,the boy was shocked
sample-2338.wav,they mounted their horses
sample-2339.wav,i'd like to build a display case for the crystal the boy said to the merchant
sample-2340.wav,in a way so am i he said
sample-2341.wav,she told me she feels hopeful and optimistic
sample-2342.wav,the woman was silent for some time
sample-2343.wav,he spent the entire morning observing the infrequent comings and goings in the street
sample-2344.wav,leanne joined a choir so everyone could hear her sublime singing voice
sample-2345.wav,i don't want to rush you
sample-2346.wav,if what one finds is made of pure matter it will never spoil
sample-2347.wav,worryingly the radio signal became weaker
sample-2348.wav,happy to know you
sample-2349.wav,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-2350.wav,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
sample-2351.wav,worked hard just to have food and water like the sheep
sample-2352.wav,i'm going to take over a lot of plates and things
sample-2353.wav,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-2354.wav,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-2355.wav,she would never know the difference because she didn't know how to read
sample-2356.wav,i'm interested only in the present
sample-2357.wav,goodbye said the boy
sample-2358.wav,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
sample-2359.wav,the men were terrified at his sorcery
sample-2360.wav,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-2361.wav,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
sample-2362.wav,the boy awoke as the sun rose
sample-2363.wav,because the crystal was dirty
sample-2364.wav,and they had understood each other perfectly well
sample-2365.wav,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-2366.wav,he forgets the office when he's with me
sample-2367.wav,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-2368.wav,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
sample-2369.wav,the boy waited and then interrupted the old man just as he himself had been interrupted
sample-2370.wav,among these people were a couple of cyclists a gardener i employed sometimes and a girl carrying a baby
sample-2371.wav,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-2372.wav,i can learn something from the desert too
sample-2373.wav,the monk was irritated
sample-2374.wav,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
sample-2375.wav,i had to test your courage the stranger said
sample-2376.wav,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-2377.wav,he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
sample-2378.wav,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-2379.wav,it was however still so hot from its flight through the air
sample-2380.wav,there's one that says 'everything that happens once can never happen again
sample-2381.wav,maybe she didn't even remember him
sample-2382.wav,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-2383.wav,then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
sample-2384.wav,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-2385.wav,the camel driver understood what the boy was saying
sample-2386.wav,he had been so far away that his face wasn't even visible
sample-2387.wav,and you ought to read more about the world answered the englishman
sample-2388.wav,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-2389.wav,there ain't any more
sample-2390.wav,he deleted five tables from the database
sample-2391.wav,the boy went to his room and packed his belongings
sample-2392.wav,i was right there and saw it with my own eyes
sample-2393.wav,you're demanding your rights
sample-2394.wav,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-2395.wav,a great humanitarian and the best friend the jessie bakers have
sample-2396.wav,but then they wouldn't be a part of your future the seer had said
sample-2397.wav,the boy trusted his new friend
sample-2398.wav,did you actually give tamara that gun
sample-2399.wav,your heart is alive
sample-24.wav,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-2401.wav,show me some gratitude
sample-2402.wav,but the boy sat down and waited
sample-2403.wav,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
sample-2404.wav,then the old man began to inspect the sheep and he saw that one was lame
sample-2405.wav,the secret is here in the present
sample-2406.wav,there were just drawings coded instructions and obscure texts
sample-2407.wav,and what do you do in salem he insisted
sample-2408.wav,but he didn't need to worry about that right now
sample-2409.wav,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-2410.wav,let's the alchemist answered
sample-2411.wav,you're the one who may die the alchemist said
sample-2412.wav,it was as if carl realised that he was a puppet under someone else's control
sample-2413.wav,it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself
sample-2414.wav,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-2415.wav,which one are you
sample-2416.wav,there was enough there to buy a lot of weapons
sample-2417.wav,know what my old man did when i joined up
sample-2418.wav,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-2419.wav,the old man returned the book to the boy
sample-2420.wav,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-2421.wav,like eating or sleeping or like seeking love or finding a job
sample-2422.wav,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-2423.wav,i found myself alone and saw the people on the other side of the pit running away
sample-2424.wav,the boy didn't know what a person's destiny was
sample-2425.wav,sometime during the second year you'll remember about the treasure
sample-2426.wav,no one paid any attention to the two travelers
sample-2427.wav,the young arab took out a book and began to read
sample-2428.wav,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
sample-2429.wav,the greatest authority on meteorites stated that the height of its first appearance was about ninety or one hundred miles
sample-2430.wav,i need you to be spontaneous he asked me out to din din
sample-2431.wav,when he emerged it was with a young arab dressed in white and gold
sample-2432.wav,we'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything
sample-2433.wav,something bright reflected from his chest with such intensity that the boy was momentarily blinded
sample-2434.wav,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
sample-2435.wav,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-2436.wav,without responding the guard entered the tent where he remained for some time
sample-2437.wav,michael opened a browser and navigated to an anonymous search engine
sample-2438.wav,because i don't live in either my past or my future
sample-2439.wav,it's late in the evening a perfect time for coffee
sample-2440.wav,the alchemists spent years in their laboratories observing the fire that purified the metals
sample-2441.wav,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-2442.wav,he must know how to deal with the snakes of the desert
sample-2443.wav,he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
sample-2444.wav,replace the ts in tim tebow's name with any other consonant to get a star wars character
sample-2445.wav,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-2446.wav,the plastic barrier shattered
sample-2447.wav,say something else
sample-2448.wav,they are not really friends they just work together and talk from time to time
sample-2449.wav,i guess i was homesick
sample-2450.wav,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-2451.wav,an army is coming the boy said
sample-2452.wav,the sun began its departure as well
sample-2453.wav,tell them to start getting those extras out
sample-2454.wav,the sword didn't fall
sample-2455.wav,what do i do in salem the old man laughed
sample-2456.wav,all they think about is food and water
sample-2457.wav,the elevators are still running
sample-2458.wav,turn on the lights
sample-2459.wav,and i'm going to build things
sample-2460.wav,help me the boy said
sample-2461.wav,caught it coming home from school
sample-2462.wav,it's a private club for only the most respectable people
sample-2463.wav,i thought the unscrewing might be automatic
sample-2464.wav,the boy was shocked
sample-2465.wav,it was just right
sample-2466.wav,give me my book the boy said
sample-2467.wav,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-2468.wav,i'm not talking about his grandfather's pet poodle
sample-2469.wav,we speak of them only to children
sample-2470.wav,that's what i'm going to do
sample-2471.wav,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-2472.wav,i don't want to take any chances
sample-2473.wav,you get out of here quick
sample-2474.wav,they'd never let you go
sample-2475.wav,the boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question
sample-2476.wav,she placed the glass carefully on the edge of the table
sample-2477.wav,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-2478.wav,you have been a real blessing to me
sample-2479.wav,i came over with johnny
sample-2480.wav,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-2481.wav,i don't know if i'll be able to find life in the desert the boy thought
sample-2482.wav,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-2483.wav,this farm had cattle chicken sheep and many other animals
sample-2484.wav,do you want to go to work for me the merchant asked
sample-2485.wav,the newspaper articles had prepared everyone for the reception of the idea
sample-2486.wav,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-2487.wav,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-2488.wav,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-2489.wav,just for the first year
sample-2490.wav,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
sample-2491.wav,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-2492.wav,and don't bump into anything
sample-2493.wav,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-2494.wav,few people realise the immensity of vacancy
sample-2495.wav,the old woman had said the same thing
sample-2496.wav,i said i wish i'd never been born
sample-2497.wav,i gave you fifty just the other day
sample-2498.wav,where is the treasure he asked
sample-2499.wav,he preferred to sit down and wait
sample-25.wav,it was the levanter the wind that came from africa
sample-2501.wav,i thought about the difficulties in translation that might arise
sample-2502.wav,happy new year to you all
sample-2503.wav,and the murmur lasted longer than a simple vow would have
sample-2504.wav,this is jon davis
sample-2505.wav,the boy awoke as the sun rose
sample-2506.wav,three cheers for aden christopher
sample-2507.wav,but none of that mattered to the alchemist
sample-2508.wav,tomorrow is another day
sample-2509.wav,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-2510.wav,once again he was experiencing the language without words
sample-2511.wav,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-2512.wav,every search begins with beginner's luck
sample-2513.wav,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
sample-2514.wav,but the boy never took his eye off his new friend
sample-2515.wav,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-2516.wav,how do i guess at the future
sample-2517.wav,yet each felt his heart beat a bit faster
sample-2518.wav,listen to your heart
sample-2519.wav,we were all made by the same hand and we have the same soul
sample-2520.wav,the boy wanted to believe that his friend had simply become separated from him by accident
sample-2521.wav,christmas eve at midnight
sample-2522.wav,first you got to sign a receipt
sample-2523.wav,it made me very depressed
sample-2524.wav,the octopus worried the squid
sample-2525.wav,the boy tried to read what was written in the sand
sample-2526.wav,the war is going to end someday the girl said
sample-2527.wav,i told you that your dream was a difficult one
sample-2528.wav,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
sample-2529.wav,you wanna take this outside
sample-2530.wav,we must be good
sample-2531.wav,think i'd better be going
sample-2532.wav,have trusted more in your love for fatima
sample-2533.wav,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-2534.wav,he decided to return to his friend's stable by the longest route possible
sample-2535.wav,he could always become a crystal salesman again
sample-2536.wav,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-2537.wav,you'll marry fatima and you'll both be happy for a year
sample-2538.wav,i guess i'm not quite the football type
sample-2539.wav,he had suddenly remembered that in tarifa there was an old woman who interpreted dreams
sample-2540.wav,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-2541.wav,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-2542.wav,the octopus worried the squid
sample-2543.wav,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-2544.wav,and he gave the boy his blessing
sample-2545.wav,she finds the world has feet of clay
sample-2546.wav,it was only when i got this close to it that the strangeness of it was at all evident to me
sample-2547.wav,a part of me is also trying to come to terms with the fact that i won't be able to travel as much anymore
sample-2548.wav,i waited all afternoon and evening he said
sample-2549.wav,carbon monoxide is a very dangerous gas
sample-2550.wav,i never said i'd take it
sample-2551.wav,his tshirt was drenched in sweat
sample-2552.wav,only chris couldn't wait quite as long as the others
sample-2553.wav,how does anything like this ever start
sample-2554.wav,when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
sample-2555.wav,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-2556.wav,the woman was silent for some time
sample-2557.wav,he came to understand its dodges and tricks and to accept it as it was
sample-2558.wav,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
sample-2559.wav,two days later the merchant spoke to the boy about the display
sample-2560.wav,he brought six sheep with him
sample-2561.wav,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-2562.wav,it helped me to trust in people the englishman answered
sample-2563.wav,we want some action in these pictures
sample-2564.wav,you knew the whole story
sample-2565.wav,if you can concentrate always on the present you'll be a happy man
sample-2566.wav,he'll be ready on time
sample-2567.wav,how they managed to improvise at such short notice she'll never know
sample-2568.wav,one afternoon they passed by the encampment of one of the tribes
sample-2569.wav,there's nobody else on the paper who can write
sample-2570.wav,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-2571.wav,everything has been written by the same hand
sample-2572.wav,you're right when you say my father was no business man
sample-2573.wav,the boy spent a sleepless night
sample-2574.wav,the money is unimportant
sample-2575.wav,but only speak a word and my servant will be healed
sample-2576.wav,one is loved because one is loved
sample-2577.wav,there was very little talking
sample-2578.wav,not only did he manage to do it he did it professionally
sample-2579.wav,the two men hurried back and found the cylinder still lying in the same position
sample-2580.wav,half an hour later his shovel hit something solid
sample-2581.wav,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-2582.wav,as they watched the waves crashing into each other alice thought of home
sample-2583.wav,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
sample-2584.wav,none of what the old man was saying made much sense to the boy
sample-2585.wav,two years ago right here on this spot i had a recurrent dream too
sample-2586.wav,you wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town
sample-2587.wav,well usually i learn more from my sheep than from books he answered
sample-2588.wav,can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-2589.wav,i'm going into business for myself
sample-2590.wav,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
sample-2591.wav,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-2592.wav,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-2593.wav,we're having hamburgers
sample-2594.wav,it was sprayed in red with yellow edges
sample-2595.wav,the authors claim to specifically address variations due to geometric transformations in the acquired images
sample-2596.wav,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-2597.wav,henderson was taking it in
sample-2598.wav,he didn't want to cry with the other people there
sample-2599.wav,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-26.wav,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-2601.wav,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-2602.wav,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-2603.wav,just one thing more
sample-2604.wav,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-2605.wav,but one of them seized the boy and yanked him back out of the hole
sample-2606.wav,they'd never let you go
sample-2607.wav,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
sample-2608.wav,you've played it over and over again
sample-2609.wav,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-2610.wav,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
sample-2611.wav,well then why did you let me do it the boy asked
sample-2612.wav,of course you wouldn't know
sample-2613.wav,the boy repeated his question
sample-2614.wav,he rose and made his way back toward the palm trees
sample-2615.wav,tell her i elected her and i can have her impeached
sample-2616.wav,or a man into the wind
sample-2617.wav,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-2618.wav,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
sample-2619.wav,everything has been written by the same hand
sample-2620.wav,stop treating me like a child
sample-2621.wav,every time he saw her he felt nervous
sample-2622.wav,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-2623.wav,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-2624.wav,you know what we're going to do
sample-2625.wav,it really ought to be easy except that right now there's an outstanding bug
sample-2626.wav,teaching kids english with common voice is a winwin situation
sample-2627.wav,it was more activity than usual for this time of the morning
sample-2628.wav,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
sample-2629.wav,the term just my two cents is about opinion not about money
sample-2630.wav,can i get a woot woot
sample-2631.wav,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-2632.wav,close shot of the colonel
sample-2633.wav,he didn't want to cry with the other people there
sample-2634.wav,he could see that the old man wanted to know more about his life
sample-2635.wav,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-2636.wav,they might even have become friends but the englishman closed off the conversation
sample-2637.wav,i heard what you were talking about the other day with the alchemist the wind said
sample-2638.wav,maybe that's why they came
sample-2639.wav,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
sample-2640.wav,i don't want anything else in life
sample-2641.wav,dee's house right now
sample-2642.wav,earlier this year we found a really nice place near my office and we moved in together
sample-2643.wav,but the alchemist continued to look to the horizon
sample-2644.wav,is there no sense of honor left in this country
sample-2645.wav,sometimes there's just no way to hold back the river
sample-2646.wav,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-2647.wav,he was alarmed by what had happened
sample-2648.wav,but we've all got to get in there and play
sample-2649.wav,there might be secret messages in this text
sample-2650.wav,i find that the best way to combat this issue is to use the builtin vocabulary editor
sample-2651.wav,he watched the hawks as they drifted on the wind
sample-2652.wav,some of our biggest clients are affected
sample-2653.wav,then he took from his knapsack a bottle of wine and drank some
sample-2654.wav,i'm leaving today said the boy
sample-2655.wav,say something else
sample-2656.wav,because the crystal was dirty
sample-2657.wav,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-2658.wav,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-2659.wav,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
sample-2660.wav,the women took turns building a tall stable pile of rocks
sample-2661.wav,then whose is it
sample-2662.wav,maybe because that wasn't really his dream
sample-2663.wav,but i never said anything like that
sample-2664.wav,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
sample-2665.wav,because you have already lost your savings twice
sample-2666.wav,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-2667.wav,came to the bar he had entered on his first day there
sample-2668.wav,and he looked out over the desert that had brought him to the woman he loved
sample-2669.wav,everyone seemed very excited
sample-2670.wav,you have no car
sample-2671.wav,we couldn't make it in a week
sample-2672.wav,the five french tourists stepped over the excited bulldogs
sample-2673.wav,you're the only one left
sample-2674.wav,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-2675.wav,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-2676.wav,did you hear what i said
sample-2677.wav,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-2678.wav,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-2679.wav,there are many languages spoken by things the boy said
sample-2680.wav,there was a general movement backwards
sample-2681.wav,i'm going to find that damned alchemist the englishman thought
sample-2682.wav,they shouted consolation and promises and went off back to the town again to get help
sample-2683.wav,they eat lunch together often but dont really talk outside the office
sample-2684.wav,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
sample-2685.wav,but i'm not through complaining yet
sample-2686.wav,it is still a phenomenal movement
sample-2687.wav,it was impossible to remember all the details that he covered in an hour
sample-2688.wav,i don't want anything else in life
sample-2689.wav,they were fascinating stories each of them lived out his destiny to the end
sample-2690.wav,i told him that was what i had come here to learn
sample-2691.wav,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-2692.wav,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-2693.wav,the burning fire had been extinguished
sample-2694.wav,i have to separate out the sulfur
sample-2695.wav,he had studied latin spanish and theology
sample-2696.wav,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-2697.wav,he felt weighted down by the centuries of time since the pyramids had been built
sample-2698.wav,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-2699.wav,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
sample-27.wav,i suppose that's true in a way
sample-2701.wav,it's past your bedtime
sample-2702.wav,yeah better if people are already familiar with one and are thinking of switching to the other
sample-2703.wav,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-2704.wav,what'll i tell him
sample-2705.wav,i'm an old superstitious arab and i believe in our proverbs
sample-2706.wav,he was thinking about omens and someone had appeared
sample-2707.wav,several figures approached him
sample-2708.wav,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-2709.wav,i guess i was homesick
sample-2710.wav,then you taught me something of the universal language and the soul of the world
sample-2711.wav,his heart was heavy and he had been melancholy since the previous night
sample-2712.wav,what day is it
sample-2713.wav,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-2714.wav,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
sample-2715.wav,the boy was getting irritated
sample-2716.wav,i ain't gonna squeal
sample-2717.wav,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-2718.wav,it was seen early in the morning rushing over eastward
sample-2719.wav,i am proud of you he said
sample-2720.wav,what are you doing up here then
sample-2721.wav,the englishman didn't answer him directly
sample-2722.wav,yeah i like that
sample-2723.wav,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-2724.wav,the wind began to blow again
sample-2725.wav,they went to the kitchen at the back of the monastery
sample-2726.wav,the insurgents gathered sticks and wood
sample-2727.wav,suddenly for no apparent reason the boy's horse began to slow
sample-2728.wav,one afternoon one of his servants fell ill and it appeared that he would die
sample-2729.wav,his father said no more
sample-2730.wav,first they tried to find him on their own
sample-2731.wav,our mortgage is in arrears
sample-2732.wav,his internet connection was too slow
sample-2733.wav,the boy was sad as he left her that day
sample-2734.wav,the angel touched the man's shoulder and they were both projected far into the future
sample-2735.wav,traveling alone is good for meeting new people
sample-2736.wav,and better still to be alone with one's books
sample-2737.wav,henderson was taking it in
sample-2738.wav,he brought six sheep with him
sample-2739.wav,because the crystal was dirty
sample-2740.wav,because for him you are a green field from which he always returns with game
sample-2741.wav,this banana tastes like cherries
sample-2742.wav,how long is it
sample-2743.wav,the steel of its blade glittered in the light of the moon
sample-2744.wav,and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
sample-2745.wav,the stranger withdrew the sword from the boy's forehead and the boy felt immensely relieved
sample-2746.wav,the omens had been true after all
sample-2747.wav,give me my robe
sample-2748.wav,he stood irresolute for a moment and then scrambled out of the pit
sample-2749.wav,do you mind if i sit down
sample-2750.wav,alchemy is a serious discipline
sample-2751.wav,what have you done with them
sample-2752.wav,you certainly delivered the goods
sample-2753.wav,how do you expect me to get any work done
sample-2754.wav,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-2755.wav,and find out where the nearest telegraph office is
sample-2756.wav,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-2757.wav,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-2758.wav,they're not concerned with that right now
sample-2759.wav,they reminded him of the old man
sample-2760.wav,they spoke about mercury salt dragons and kings and he didn't understand any of it
sample-2761.wav,as he did so he talked with the monk about the tribal wars
sample-2762.wav,that's about the best description i know
sample-2763.wav,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-2764.wav,mayonnaise is made from eggs oil vinegar and mustard
sample-2765.wav,carol saved her brother's life that day
sample-2766.wav,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-2767.wav,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-2768.wav,did you ever walk into this office
sample-2769.wav,you hit my best friend
sample-2770.wav,now i'm beginning what i could have started ten years ago
sample-2771.wav,the boy went to the well every day to meet with fatima
sample-2772.wav,we can't leave greg here
sample-2773.wav,i can help him
sample-2774.wav,have you got the speech i gave you
sample-2775.wav,she's just about to close up the library
sample-2776.wav,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-2777.wav,and it's not love to see everything from a distance like you do
sample-2778.wav,diy projects can help you save money and tailor things to your needs
sample-2779.wav,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-2780.wav,this is for you
sample-2781.wav,you have a mania for simplifying everything answered the englishman irritated
sample-2782.wav,to keep on pitching
sample-2783.wav,they blow across the world without a birthplace and with no place to die
sample-2784.wav,it's a nasty day
sample-2785.wav,the shepherd swore that he would
sample-2786.wav,he is going to transform himself into the wind just to demonstrate his powers
sample-2787.wav,you can't offer me something that is already mine the chief said arrogantly
sample-2788.wav,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-2789.wav,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-2790.wav,the desert fills men's hearts with visions the camel driver answered
sample-2791.wav,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-2792.wav,i never saw amanda act like that before
sample-2793.wav,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-2794.wav,some of the grey ash was falling off the circular edge
sample-2795.wav,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-2796.wav,the horizon was tinged with red and suddenly the sun appeared
sample-2797.wav,that's why i'm here
sample-2798.wav,there's a bunch of autograph seekers out front
sample-2799.wav,never mind those guys
sample-28.wav,the boy thought of fatima
sample-2801.wav,but before i go i want to tell you a little story
sample-2802.wav,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-2803.wav,once to the thief and once to the general
sample-2804.wav,at most they thought that another meteorite had descended
sample-2805.wav,it seemed such a little thing so bright and small and still
sample-2806.wav,it had a diameter of about thirty yards
sample-2807.wav,there was no excuse for goodman to fly off the handle
sample-2808.wav,i'm interested only in the present
sample-2809.wav,at night they spread their sleeping gear and kept their fires hidden
sample-2810.wav,the omens had told him so
sample-2811.wav,the only things that concerned the sheep were food and water
sample-2812.wav,the alchemist's words echoed out like a curse
sample-2813.wav,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-2814.wav,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-2815.wav,it's not my house
sample-2816.wav,the genies were the spirits of good and evil
sample-2817.wav,are you in the book
sample-2818.wav,it almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted
sample-2819.wav,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
sample-2820.wav,everybody quiet and ready for an emergency
sample-2821.wav,throughout the entire day we will be on the lookout for our enemies
sample-2822.wav,can i go now
sample-2823.wav,what is it you're looking for asked the old merchant
sample-2824.wav,he knew all the fields and pastures of andalusia
sample-2825.wav,he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
sample-2826.wav,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-2827.wav,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
sample-2828.wav,it drew a droplet of blood
sample-2829.wav,it's not what enters men's mouths that's evil said the alchemist
sample-2830.wav,it's called the principle of favorability beginner's luck
sample-2831.wav,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-2832.wav,the boy thought it a strange question
sample-2833.wav,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-2834.wav,you got your watermelon
sample-2835.wav,mister kristen has something to say to us
sample-2836.wav,i lost my wallet
sample-2837.wav,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-2838.wav,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-2839.wav,and in that mood he was grateful to be in love
sample-2840.wav,he transformed himself into a stone that rolled up to the miner's foot
sample-2841.wav,and also by unhappiness envy and jealousy
sample-2842.wav,they walked together through the narrow streets of tangier
sample-2843.wav,there was a general movement backwards
sample-2844.wav,when i tried it about a year ago it didn't work nearly as well as using it on my local machine
sample-2845.wav,the emerald tablet is a direct passage to the soul of the world
sample-2846.wav,he was shaken into wakefulness by someone
sample-2847.wav,he carried two dead hawks over his shoulder
sample-2848.wav,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
sample-2849.wav,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-2850.wav,whenever he saw the sea or a fire he fell silent impressed by their elemental force
sample-2851.wav,there was surely a baker in her town
sample-2852.wav,she had her cardigan on
sample-2853.wav,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-2854.wav,send those other people in
sample-2855.wav,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-2856.wav,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
sample-2857.wav,what have you got to report
sample-2858.wav,she may be lost
sample-2859.wav,any time but christmas
sample-2860.wav,better bring me a glass of milk
sample-2861.wav,why couldn't you just look at his feet
sample-2862.wav,the levanter increased in intensity
sample-2863.wav,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-2864.wav,you came so that you could learn about your dreams said the old woman
sample-2865.wav,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
sample-2866.wav,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-2867.wav,the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-2868.wav,that isn't what i got married for
sample-2869.wav,and he immediately felt peace in his heart
sample-2870.wav,we want you to know that we're all for you
sample-2871.wav,she can't get away
sample-2872.wav,not everyone can see his dreams come true in the same way
sample-2873.wav,he listened to the wind and felt the stones beneath his feet
sample-2874.wav,the millennium edition of the album contains multiple remixes and the lyrics
sample-2875.wav,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-2876.wav,the girl dropped the container and the water spilled
sample-2877.wav,my review of the sun one star
sample-2878.wav,i thought about whether we should find coins and models in it and so on
sample-2879.wav,and a labor leader like melville
sample-2880.wav,it must have fallen while i was sitting over there
sample-2881.wav,collateral of any kind
sample-2882.wav,look where you're going
sample-2883.wav,the paper presents a variant of a hidden markov model for images
sample-2884.wav,we lit the lantern and walked over to his house
sample-2885.wav,today i understand something i didn't see before every blessing ignored becomes a curse
sample-2886.wav,they become a part of everything
sample-2887.wav,the tricky part is integrating it with dragonfly
sample-2888.wav,the boy was shocked
sample-2889.wav,she comes by it naturally
sample-2890.wav,you haven't told me
sample-2891.wav,the levanter increased in intensity
sample-2892.wav,what is it that i still need to know the boy asked
sample-2893.wav,the boy recalled the brilliance he had noticed on the previous day
sample-2894.wav,i have had the same dream twice he said
sample-2895.wav,i'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this
sample-2896.wav,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-2897.wav,i need some coffee
sample-2898.wav,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-2899.wav,it's not so bad
sample-29.wav,but everything had changed
sample-2901.wav,he had used the two stones only once one morning when he was at a marketplace
sample-2902.wav,that's rather big talk
sample-2903.wav,i gotta figure some way out of this thing
sample-2904.wav,hundreds must have seen it and taken it for a falling star
sample-2905.wav,i wished i had a light to smoke by
sample-2906.wav,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-2907.wav,they were men of the desert and they were fearful of sorcerers
sample-2908.wav,what is it that i still need to know the boy asked
sample-2909.wav,does the name brian anderson mean anything to you
sample-2910.wav,this is keith miller
sample-2911.wav,she bought cucumbers at the marketplace
sample-2912.wav,and then the boy understood
sample-2913.wav,this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
sample-2914.wav,now i too will be one of the women who wait
sample-2915.wav,you've got a nerve accusing people of things
sample-2916.wav,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-2917.wav,give me the district attorney's office
sample-2918.wav,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
sample-2919.wav,you can't kid me
sample-2920.wav,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-2921.wav,show me the movie schedule for whore ii
sample-2922.wav,in those days very few of the people had any idea about astronomy
sample-2923.wav,ill join you in a minute after i lock my bike
sample-2924.wav,even the guides spoke very little to one another
sample-2925.wav,what's the fifth obligation the boy asked
sample-2926.wav,he wasn't asking for help
sample-2927.wav,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-2928.wav,all they wanted was food and water
sample-2929.wav,it was there that the wise man lived
sample-2930.wav,the two were taken to a nearby military camp
sample-2931.wav,then he turned to the boy this time his expression was cold and distant
sample-2932.wav,i swear it on my mother's grave
sample-2933.wav,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-2934.wav,the insurgents gathered sticks and wood
sample-2935.wav,you've got about two minutes
sample-2936.wav,then why do you suppose he hasn't at least called up
sample-2937.wav,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-2938.wav,in any case it's good that you've learned that everything in life has its price
sample-2939.wav,he had seen the shooting star and was persuaded that a meteorite lay somewhere nearby
sample-2940.wav,the crowd swayed a little as i elbowed my way through
sample-2941.wav,show the times for animated movies in the nearest movie house
sample-2942.wav,i'm never more aware of a room's acoustics than when i'm trying to enjoy a snack i have no intention of sharing
sample-2943.wav,the mixture took on a reddish color almost the color of blood
sample-2944.wav,the alchemist was a bit daunting but as the boy drank the wine he relaxed
sample-2945.wav,an alchemist said the alchemist
sample-2946.wav,and also because i know about the soul of the world he thought to himself
sample-2947.wav,i'll take mine now
sample-2948.wav,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-2949.wav,the boy awoke before dawn
sample-2950.wav,would you like to see where i was tattooed
sample-2951.wav,it seems old and wise
sample-2952.wav,what's from the governor
sample-2953.wav,when you play cards the first time you are almost sure to win
sample-2954.wav,this is what was written on the emerald tablet said the alchemist when he had finished
sample-2955.wav,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-2956.wav,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-2957.wav,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-2958.wav,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-2959.wav,but maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language
sample-2960.wav,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-2961.wav,but i didnt think that it contained any living creature
sample-2962.wav,the sun is friendly right now but it will turn on us and consume this planet
sample-2963.wav,the boy awoke as the sun rose
sample-2964.wav,it was a tent like many at the oasis
sample-2965.wav,i would have won the junior olympics if not for those medaling kids
sample-2966.wav,the same hand that had brandished the sword now held a whip
sample-2967.wav,so the boy was disappointed he decided that he would never again believe in dreams
sample-2968.wav,in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
sample-2969.wav,something just flew by
sample-2970.wav,they are so used to me that they know my schedule he muttered
sample-2971.wav,the caravans had been stopped at giza for some time waiting for the wars to end
sample-2972.wav,let me comb your hair
sample-2973.wav,but she hadn't charged him anything
sample-2974.wav,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-2975.wav,a poor little fellow that never meant nobody no harm
sample-2976.wav,my greatgrandfather planted this tree
sample-2977.wav,who told you about omens the boy's interest was increasing by the moment
sample-2978.wav,fatima is a woman of the desert said the alchemist
sample-2979.wav,you would have to have been born an arab to understand he answered
sample-2980.wav,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-2981.wav,that's what i did before i married charles
sample-2982.wav,flaring torches were filling the dungeon with an ambient noise
sample-2983.wav,the sparrow and the songbird danced along the fence
sample-2984.wav,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-2985.wav,this wasn't a strange place it was a new one
sample-2986.wav,it's a good thing i got here in time
sample-2987.wav,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-2988.wav,the book that most interested the boy told the stories of the famous alchemists
sample-2989.wav,he needed someone to talk to so as to avoid thinking about the possibility of war
sample-2990.wav,he tried again to concentrate on the pink shades of the desert and its stones
sample-2991.wav,four hundred and fifty dollars
sample-2992.wav,fifty cents on the dollar
sample-2993.wav,they locked themselves in their laboratories and tried to evolve as gold had
sample-2994.wav,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
sample-2995.wav,whatever the thing observed one could find a connection with his experience of the moment
sample-2996.wav,it's always nice if you can learn something new isn't it
sample-2997.wav,i've got to decorate my tree
sample-2998.wav,just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
sample-2999.wav,roger the backup team is on the way
sample-3.wav,it drew a droplet of blood
sample-31.wav,the brake fluid was leaking out onto the path
sample-32.wav,then the thing came upon him in a flash
sample-33.wav,then suddenly he noticed it with a start
sample-34.wav,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
sample-35.wav,i told him we could teach her to ignore people who waste her time
sample-36.wav,on the following day the first clear sign of danger appeared
sample-37.wav,hunches his mother used to call them
sample-38.wav,go into your dance
sample-39.wav,darren never saw a bottle till he was six months old
sample-3010.wav,the boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did the same
sample-3011.wav,the boy was shocked
sample-3012.wav,it looked like a rusty gas float
sample-3013.wav,the man was speaking the language of alchemy
sample-3014.wav,the englishman was disappointed
sample-3015.wav,tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
sample-3016.wav,looking around he sought his sheep and then realized that he was in a new world
sample-3017.wav,i'm a woman of the desert she said averting her face
sample-3018.wav,a large piece suddenly came off and fell with a loud and sharp noise
sample-3019.wav,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
sample-3020.wav,you don't call this a convenience
sample-3021.wav,they also began to feel that they knew a better way than others had
sample-3022.wav,but i like it that way
sample-3023.wav,it was only words
sample-3024.wav,the internet should reflect all of the people who use it
sample-3025.wav,it was our money and we want it back
sample-3026.wav,and he told what he had seen
sample-3027.wav,what do you know about this
sample-3028.wav,men dream more about coming home than about leaving the boy said
sample-3029.wav,that's why i'm an angel second class
sample-3030.wav,he walked slowly through the market
sample-3031.wav,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-3032.wav,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-3033.wav,i heard a faint movement under my feet
sample-3034.wav,one minute to go
sample-3035.wav,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-3036.wav,because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-3037.wav,but instead of being saddened he was happy
sample-3038.wav,i don't want to take any chances
sample-3039.wav,all you've got to do is talk to him
sample-3040.wav,that's why i keep losing
sample-3041.wav,and you can quote me on that
sample-3042.wav,they had gone away to breakfast at henderson's house
sample-3043.wav,its important to keep an open mind and she has urged me to do the same
sample-3044.wav,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-3045.wav,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-3046.wav,but he kept the sword in his hand
sample-3047.wav,because i don't love him
sample-3048.wav,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-3049.wav,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-3050.wav,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-3051.wav,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-3052.wav,all i want to do is be let alone
sample-3053.wav,she never told her that
sample-3054.wav,servants came and went with silver trays laden with spices and tea
sample-3055.wav,they all complain they're practically working for the government
sample-3056.wav,he placed urim and thummim in the chest
sample-3057.wav,listen to your heart
sample-3058.wav,why should i be in any danger
sample-3059.wav,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-3060.wav,it's not i the wind spoke about
sample-3061.wav,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-3062.wav,when he had completed the cleaning he asked the man for something to eat
sample-3063.wav,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
sample-3064.wav,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-3065.wav,the day was dawning and the shepherd urged his sheep in the direction of the sun
sample-3066.wav,they're not my sheep anymore he said to himself without nostalgia
sample-3067.wav,let's call him up
sample-3068.wav,he took the fourth part and handed it to the monk
sample-3069.wav,he took out one of the stones
sample-3070.wav,the levanter increased in intensity
sample-3071.wav,during the third year the omens will continue to speak of your treasure and your destiny
sample-3072.wav,there was no need to imprison them the arabs simply confiscated their horses
sample-3073.wav,he said that everything has its own destiny
sample-3074.wav,i gotta figure some way out of this thing
sample-3075.wav,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-3076.wav,the turf and gravel around it seemed charred as if by a sudden explosion
sample-3077.wav,all the birds began to sing at the first light of dawn
sample-3078.wav,the boy had met the alchemist
sample-3079.wav,it's a beautiful miracle
sample-3080.wav,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-3081.wav,shame on you and get off my front porch
sample-3082.wav,there's nobody else on the paper who can write
sample-3083.wav,there were lights in the upper windows of the houses when the people went to bed
sample-3084.wav,and she already has her treasure it's you
sample-3085.wav,those are the rules of war the leader explained
sample-3086.wav,the boy felt ill and terribly alone
sample-3087.wav,bush leagues mostly
sample-3088.wav,came to the bar he had entered on his first day there
sample-3089.wav,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
sample-3090.wav,are you sure you're comfortable
sample-3091.wav,henderson was taking it in
sample-3092.wav,a large portion of the cylinder had been uncovered
sample-3093.wav,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-3094.wav,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-3095.wav,benjamin was snacking on strips of bacon
sample-3096.wav,the boy was relieved
sample-3097.wav,he felt uneasy at the man's presence
sample-3098.wav,they wanted to save the oasis
sample-3099.wav,are you really fred's brother
sample-31.wav,one day the earth began to tremble and the nile overflowed its banks
sample-3101.wav,in those times the master work could be written simply on an emerald
sample-3102.wav,and one or two persons were returning
sample-3103.wav,there were really i think two or three hundred people elbowing one another
sample-3104.wav,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-3105.wav,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-3106.wav,but we could sell tea in crystal glasses
sample-3107.wav,that's never happened to me the boy said
sample-3108.wav,my chinchilla eats bread
sample-3109.wav,the alchemist dismounted slowly and the boy did the same
sample-3110.wav,his life and his path had always provided him with enough omens
sample-3111.wav,i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
sample-3112.wav,the strange horseman drew an enormous curved sword from a scabbard mounted on his saddle
sample-3113.wav,give me the district attorney's office
sample-3114.wav,having heard that the boy became even more interested in alchemy
sample-3115.wav,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-3116.wav,sort of a jack london style
sample-3117.wav,when you are in love things make even more sense he thought
sample-3118.wav,now im scared of what is inside of pies
sample-3119.wav,are children more creative than adults
sample-3120.wav,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
sample-3121.wav,i'm doing everything humanly possible
sample-3122.wav,it's called the principle of favorability
sample-3123.wav,they were given to me as a present by a king the boy said
sample-3124.wav,then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy
sample-3125.wav,as i watched the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller
sample-3126.wav,of course the two were unable to do anything
sample-3127.wav,everything has been written by the same hand
sample-3128.wav,he was twenty minutes from his tent and began to make his way there
sample-3129.wav,he didn't want his hand to begin trembling showing the old woman that he was fearful
sample-3130.wav,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-3131.wav,what difference does it make what time it is
sample-3132.wav,the usage of high information content is meaningless
sample-3133.wav,what is an alchemist he asked finally
sample-3134.wav,when i'm eating that's all i think about
sample-3135.wav,more good luck telegrams
sample-3136.wav,i don't know the desert that well yet
sample-3137.wav,the alchemist removed the pan from the fire and set it aside to cool
sample-3138.wav,you've been doing mighty good work lately
sample-3139.wav,when the lead had become liquid the alchemist took from his pouch the strange yellow egg
sample-3140.wav,you sure nothing's missing
sample-3141.wav,maybe it was because they moved around so much
sample-3142.wav,i'm the leader of the caravan said a darkeyed bearded man
sample-3143.wav,in my fantasy i can guarantee harmony for all eternity
sample-3144.wav,it's what you have always wanted to accomplish
sample-3145.wav,let him have everything he wants
sample-3146.wav,nope not going unless they have a giant inflatable slide
sample-3147.wav,the letter from kelsey jane
sample-3148.wav,what idiot wrote this total drivel
sample-3149.wav,the cover of the magazine showed a cute puppy
sample-3150.wav,i've already told you
sample-3151.wav,i am following my destiny
sample-3152.wav,it was just that he couldn't grasp what it meant
sample-3153.wav,he had assumed he would soon return to his sheep
sample-3154.wav,the alchemist rode in front with the falcon on his shoulder
sample-3155.wav,more good luck telegrams
sample-3156.wav,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-3157.wav,was the doctor here
sample-3158.wav,the greatest yarn ever written by anybody
sample-3159.wav,and one can always come back
sample-3160.wav,and for wise men gold is the metal that evolved the furthest
sample-3161.wav,an huge hole had been made by the impact of the projectile
sample-3162.wav,there were snickers from the background
sample-3163.wav,you dominated those horsemen with the way you looked at them he said
sample-3164.wav,you seem to think i've never done this before
sample-3165.wav,but i was also stumbling because i couldnt look away from these things
sample-3166.wav,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-3167.wav,opening the source code can be a measure to create trust in software
sample-3168.wav,many of whom are homeless and hungry
sample-3169.wav,the following night the boy appeared at the alchemist's tent with a horse
sample-3170.wav,they rode for the entire day
sample-3171.wav,i would if i thought i'd hear anything worth listening to
sample-3172.wav,and the falcon then nourishes man
sample-3173.wav,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-3174.wav,because you are trying to realize your destiny
sample-3175.wav,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-3176.wav,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-3177.wav,that man is terrific
sample-3178.wav,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-3179.wav,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-3180.wav,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-3181.wav,he offered the kids some icecream
sample-3182.wav,i'm not supposed to tell
sample-3183.wav,since then i haven't been able to get another one
sample-3184.wav,how long is it
sample-3185.wav,so the wind blew with all its strength and the sky was filled with sand
sample-3186.wav,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-3187.wav,there's that reprieve if they ever find out
sample-3188.wav,so we their hearts speak more and more softly
sample-3189.wav,you'll weaken when you see that little jezebel
sample-3190.wav,it left a greenish streak that glowed for some seconds
sample-3191.wav,i finally have enough money and all the time i need
sample-3192.wav,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-3193.wav,it's extremely suspicious that there's no information about brains that didn't come from a brain
sample-3194.wav,the night was warm and i was thirsty
sample-3195.wav,this was a lie and they all knew it
sample-3196.wav,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-3197.wav,so you can kill me too
sample-3198.wav,spotted dick is a classic british pudding
sample-3199.wav,because the crystal was dirty
sample-32.wav,the boy stepped closer to the girl and when she smiled he did the same
sample-3201.wav,the accommodation was affordable and cosy
sample-3202.wav,the englishman prodded him and the boy asked her about the man who cured people's illnesses
sample-3203.wav,everywhere there were stalls with items for sale
sample-3204.wav,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-3205.wav,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-3206.wav,what do you want me to do
sample-3207.wav,i should have repeated it for him
sample-3208.wav,once to the thief and once to the general
sample-3209.wav,how about a little service
sample-3210.wav,henderson was taking it in
sample-3211.wav,it's not so bad
sample-3212.wav,not what you'd call rich
sample-3213.wav,there were raised voicesand some sort of struggle appeared to be going on 
sample-3214.wav,the woman said she had never heard of such a person and hurried away
sample-3215.wav,we felt that something was following us through the woods
sample-3216.wav,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-3217.wav,maybe that's why they give up on it so early too
sample-3218.wav,here's some cheese you like
sample-3219.wav,the invaders carried the name everywhere the beautiful girl spoke of the invaders with pride
sample-3220.wav,what's going on here
sample-3221.wav,will i learn to do that someday the boy asked
sample-3222.wav,i have watched the caravan as it crossed the desert he said
sample-3223.wav,even me  i haven't thought of other women since i met the merchant's daughter
sample-3224.wav,you can't do that to me
sample-3225.wav,the merchant looked anxiously at the boy
sample-3226.wav,nearby was the englishman reading a book
sample-3227.wav,the whole police force standing on it's ear
sample-3228.wav,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-3229.wav,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-3230.wav,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-3231.wav,i'll never get this speech right
sample-3232.wav,you couldn't get a bigger bed in here though
sample-3233.wav,he was already re accustomed to desert's silence
sample-3234.wav,about eleven i walked back to my home in maybury because nothing seemed to be happening
sample-3235.wav,but nowhere could he find his new companion
sample-3236.wav,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-3237.wav,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-3238.wav,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-3239.wav,that makes sense the alchemist answered
sample-3240.wav,he stuck his hand into the pouch and felt around for one of the stones
sample-3241.wav,there was a full moon and the boy told the englishman the story of his life
sample-3242.wav,i don't want to rush you
sample-3243.wav,what's for dinner tonight
sample-3244.wav,as if i had the money back in a safe
sample-3245.wav,an hour later he had before him a chest of spanish gold coins
sample-3246.wav,the top had certainly ceased to rotate
sample-3247.wav,but she said nothing
sample-3248.wav,i think they perceived that nothing was to be done at the moment
sample-3249.wav,there were mountains in the distance
sample-3250.wav,looking up he saw a pair of hawks flying high in the sky
sample-3251.wav,i don't blame them
sample-3252.wav,i know why i want to get back to my flock he thought
sample-3253.wav,your dentist called yesterday
sample-3254.wav,i was wondering if you would work on this project with me because i cant find anyone else
sample-3255.wav,but now i'm sad and alone
sample-3256.wav,would you show these gentlemen to the door
sample-3257.wav,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-3258.wav,the sea has lived on in this shell because that's its destiny
sample-3259.wav,everyone when they are young knows what their destiny is
sample-3260.wav,then suddenly they kneel and die
sample-3261.wav,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-3262.wav,i've already had that experience with my sheep and now it's happening with people
sample-3263.wav,he got up early with the idea of finding it
sample-3264.wav,better let me talk to him
sample-3265.wav,the ivy climbed up the building and wrapped itself around the chimney
sample-3266.wav,that sobered him a little
sample-3267.wav,kate frank's a baker
sample-3268.wav,if we serve tea in crystal the shop is going to expand
sample-3269.wav,i'll be back in a minute
sample-3270.wav,he began to dig at the base of the sycamore
sample-3271.wav,that's right said the old man able to read the boy's thoughts
sample-3272.wav,he was learning a lot of new things
sample-3273.wav,i shall make us some ice cubes
sample-3274.wav,why was it that he wanted the boy to serve as his instrument
sample-3275.wav,but when the reign of tiberius ended his poems were forgotten
sample-3276.wav,henderson stood up with a spade in his hand
sample-3277.wav,i don't understand what you're talking about the desert said
sample-3278.wav,at the camp it was difficult to see anything
sample-3279.wav,the land was ruined and i had to find some other way to earn a living
sample-3280.wav,if someone isn't what others want them to be the others become angry
sample-3281.wav,wear the blue one
sample-3282.wav,i can't do that
sample-3283.wav,the alchemist knocked on the gate of the monastery
sample-3284.wav,of course it's the place
sample-3285.wav,get me walter burns
sample-3286.wav,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
sample-3287.wav,as they moved along the boy tried to listen to his heart
sample-3288.wav,he was immensely excited at the news
sample-3289.wav,i locked eyes with a fish in the tank
sample-3290.wav,she likes you well enough to stick around
sample-3291.wav,i've got to talk to you straight from the shoulder
sample-3292.wav,what does she look like
sample-3293.wav,the wind screamed with delight and blew harder than ever
sample-3294.wav,and look how many things the wind already knew how to do
sample-3295.wav,i pointed out mars a bright dot of light
sample-3296.wav,one by one the campfires were extinguished and the oasis fell as quiet as the desert
sample-3297.wav,he had already seen many people come and go and the desert remained as it was
sample-3298.wav,that sobered him a little
sample-3299.wav,i'm going to tell her what i think of her
sample-33.wav,he followed the movement of the birds trying to read something into it
sample-3301.wav,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-3302.wav,henderson was taking it in
sample-3303.wav,people talk a lot about omens thought the shepherd
sample-3304.wav,don't be a fool
sample-3305.wav,don't hurt my finger again
sample-3306.wav,until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
sample-3307.wav,he paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year
sample-3308.wav,as he looked at the stones he felt relieved for some reason
sample-3309.wav,the time must have been somewhere around six o'clock
sample-3310.wav,and yet none of these people has ever met the old king
sample-3311.wav,the boy was also saddened his friend was in pursuit of his destiny
sample-3312.wav,it always helps to be learning something new and exciting
sample-3313.wav,i'm going to become bitter and distrustful of people because one person betrayed me
sample-3314.wav,i'll make such a mess of things without you
sample-3315.wav,the train pulled into the station
sample-3316.wav,people from all over the world have passed through this village son said his father
sample-3317.wav,sometimes their caravan met with another
sample-3318.wav,the only shadow was that of the few scattered pine trees
sample-3319.wav,you'll marry fatima and you'll both be happy for a year
sample-3320.wav,everything on earth is being continuously transformed because the earth is alive
sample-3321.wav,the gods should not have desires because they don't have destinies
sample-3322.wav,and they attacked an empty tent
sample-3323.wav,some storms are worth the wreckage
sample-3324.wav,before this i always looked to the desert with longing said fatima
sample-3325.wav,have a good look
sample-3326.wav,then like a colony of worker ants they dismantled their stalls and left
sample-3327.wav,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-3328.wav,i felt a chill down my spine
sample-3329.wav,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-3330.wav,the scottish parliament contains politicians
sample-3331.wav,most of them were staring quietly at the big table
sample-3332.wav,makes about five thousand a year
sample-3333.wav,i want my husband to wander as free as the wind that shapes the dunes
sample-3334.wav,i'm at the end of my rope
sample-3335.wav,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-3336.wav,how do you expect me to get any work done
sample-3337.wav,a practice of infidels he said to himself
sample-3338.wav,here's some cheese you like
sample-3339.wav,let's have your story
sample-3340.wav,he told her about the morning's meeting
sample-3341.wav,one can imagine these two covered with sand running up the little street in the bright sunlight
sample-3342.wav,then suddenly they kneel and die
sample-3343.wav,from atop its walls one can catch a glimpse of africa
sample-3344.wav,it was glaringly hot not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind
sample-3345.wav,out with larry's deputies
sample-3346.wav,i'll see that she gets the flowers
sample-3347.wav,you'll marry fatima and you'll both be happy for a year
sample-3348.wav,i had the everyone has gary busey's teeth dream again
sample-3349.wav,i want you to help me turn myself into the wind the boy answered
sample-3350.wav,where are they gone
sample-3351.wav,it has happened many times before
sample-3352.wav,just for the first year
sample-3353.wav,haven't you even started
sample-3354.wav,i'll show you what i'm doing
sample-3355.wav,that's rather big talk
sample-3356.wav,you can't believe it's not butter
sample-3357.wav,on the third day the chief met with his officers
sample-3358.wav,she composed an emotional song in her bedroom
sample-3359.wav,do you understand that
sample-3360.wav,how'd you get out
sample-3361.wav,once this is done deepspeech can be used to train a highquality open source recognition engine
sample-3362.wav,what else are you
sample-3363.wav,when she saw the unknown object bobbing up and down the edge she was absolutely horrified
sample-3364.wav,oh they're laughing at me
sample-3365.wav,somehow the paragraphs blurred into each other
sample-3366.wav,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-3367.wav,you're right when you say my father was no business man
sample-3368.wav,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-3369.wav,the englishman was disappointed
sample-3370.wav,i'll talk to you tonight
sample-3371.wav,the trade union was negotiating higher loans with the other stakeholders
sample-3372.wav,this is a common misconception sheldon said
sample-3373.wav,who wants to see liver pills
sample-3374.wav,looking down at the spoon he held the boy saw that the oil was gone
sample-3375.wav,people saw me coming and welcomed me he thought
sample-3376.wav,i'm going with you the boy said
sample-3377.wav,well then why do we need all these books the boy asked
sample-3378.wav,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-3379.wav,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-3380.wav,i went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the dark
sample-3381.wav,want to give my flower a drink
sample-3382.wav,there was a shimmering green light emanating from the statue
sample-3383.wav,were you paid for it or weren't you
sample-3384.wav,i don't know you from adam
sample-3385.wav,that first day everyone slept from exhaustion including the englishman
sample-3386.wav,he didn't consider mending the hole  the stones could fall through any time they wanted
sample-3387.wav,and maybe it wasn't that they were teaching me but that i was learning from them
sample-3388.wav,i just wanted to be sure
sample-3389.wav,she needs to get her transcripts and passport first
sample-3390.wav,three armed tribesmen approached and asked what the boy and the alchemist were doing there
sample-3391.wav,i haven't been able to shake him since
sample-3392.wav,he knew nothing about the customs of the strange land he was in
sample-3393.wav,the old man was probably a gypsy too
sample-3394.wav,lots of places sell tea around here the merchant said
sample-3395.wav,i have already described the appearance of that colossal bulk which was embedded in the ground
sample-3396.wav,these are the spies said one of the men
sample-3397.wav,but that's the jail
sample-3398.wav,the stranger seemed satisfied with the answer
sample-3399.wav,this convention's gonna cost plenty
sample-34.wav,he proposed a solution
sample-3401.wav,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-3402.wav,now leave us alone said the boy to the young arab
sample-3403.wav,johnathan assessed the situation carefully
sample-3404.wav,that's all mark ever talks about
sample-3405.wav,the vision vanished immediately but it had shaken him
sample-3406.wav,because my eyes are not yet accustomed to the desert the boy said
sample-3407.wav,the old man knew how to read and had already read the book
sample-3408.wav,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-3409.wav,two days ago you said that i had never dreamed of travel the merchant answered
sample-3410.wav,first he had studied esperanto then the world's religions and now it was alchemy
sample-3411.wav,what am i doing
sample-3412.wav,it was engineering at its finest
sample-3413.wav,because the crystal was dirty
sample-3414.wav,from that day on it was the desert that would be important
sample-3415.wav,the boy prodded them one by one with his crook calling each by name
sample-3416.wav,another person was there to help him toward his destiny
sample-3417.wav,i'll phone them right away to get that story
sample-3418.wav,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
sample-3419.wav,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-3420.wav,you must love the desert but never trust it completely
sample-3421.wav,in his hand he grasped a snake by the tail
sample-3422.wav,at his side was the young arab the boy had spoken with earlier
sample-3423.wav,when he was a child that man wanted to travel too
sample-3424.wav,i have been waiting for you here at this oasis for a long time
sample-3425.wav,all things are one
sample-3426.wav,the townsfolk were all chumps
sample-3427.wav,it was as if it quivered but really this was the telescope vibrating
sample-3428.wav,she has the most lovely smile i have ever seen
sample-3429.wav,we're in no hurry the chief answered
sample-3430.wav,the brake fluid was leaking out onto the path
sample-3431.wav,i came to tell you just one thing the boy said
sample-3432.wav,their faces were hidden behind blue veils with only their eyes showing
sample-3433.wav,air was either entering or escaping at the rim with a thin sizzling sound
sample-3434.wav,you can't talk to her like that though
sample-3435.wav,like an old fire horse
sample-3436.wav,of course there is
sample-3437.wav,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-3438.wav,saved us another building
sample-3439.wav,he believed in omens
sample-3440.wav,my review of the sun one star
sample-3441.wav,you should see the other guy specifically how good at fighting he is
sample-3442.wav,saved us another building
sample-3443.wav,its lower end was still embedded
sample-3444.wav,vibrations of peace throughout the tent
sample-3445.wav,sam's crazy about mick
sample-3446.wav,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-3447.wav,the nearby city of ceuta had grown faster than tangier and business had fallen off
sample-3448.wav,a line of flame high can be seen in the atmosphere
sample-3449.wav,you can find it here or linked from the navigation sidebar on every page
sample-3450.wav,i have a taxi waiting downstairs
sample-3451.wav,i'm afraid the joke's on us
sample-3452.wav,been seeing me in your dreams
sample-3453.wav,i'm also going back to paris today
sample-3454.wav,melchizedek watched a small ship that was plowing its way out of the port
sample-3455.wav,you've got just ten minutes
sample-3456.wav,he really was a king
sample-3457.wav,get your guns out
sample-3458.wav,the loafers and golf caddies were used to hanging out near the railway station
sample-3459.wav,he disappeared into the tent
sample-3460.wav,we beat the whole country on that story
sample-3461.wav,sodium chloride is just common table salt
sample-3462.wav,sam's crazy about mick
sample-3463.wav,you were seen at the enemy camp three days ago
sample-3464.wav,he was excited and at the same time uneasy maybe the girl had already forgotten him
sample-3465.wav,you'd think i was on the witness stand
sample-3466.wav,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
sample-3467.wav,what're you trying to do
sample-3468.wav,and one or two persons were returning
sample-3469.wav,you know where i live
sample-3470.wav,life attracts life the alchemist answered
sample-3471.wav,the things that pop up at the last minute
sample-3472.wav,i don't know how to find life in the desert the boy said
sample-3473.wav,one must prepare for it
sample-3474.wav,a boy came running towards me
sample-3475.wav,everything i do is friendly
sample-3476.wav,i don't care what you say
sample-3477.wav,they looked for the fallen mass but found nothing
sample-3478.wav,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-3479.wav,the conspiracy nuts will love this
sample-3480.wav,why can't you be serious
sample-3481.wav,until then he had considered the omens to be things of this world
sample-3482.wav,the desert takes our men from us and they don't always return she said
sample-3483.wav,no doubt the impact had caused a flash of fire
sample-3484.wav,i'd love to see you try and convince them of that
sample-3485.wav,what's the idea of locking this
sample-3486.wav,then it became a signal of danger
sample-3487.wav,coming home a party of tourists passed us singing and playing music
sample-3488.wav,the heather was on fire and you could see a thin blue smoke rising up slowly
sample-3489.wav,where is the treasure he asked
sample-3490.wav,so that was it
sample-3491.wav,better bring me a glass of milk
sample-3492.wav,he saw that fatima's eyes were filled with tears
sample-3493.wav,they were people of the desert and clamored to hear his stories about the great cities
sample-3494.wav,then one day the boy returned the books to the englishman
sample-3495.wav,she learned how to play the piano in a music school
sample-3496.wav,but i'm going to egypt the boy said
sample-3497.wav,you killed all three of them for nothing
sample-3498.wav,he was learning a lot of new things
sample-3499.wav,many people in berkshire surrey and middlesex must have seen it
sample-35.wav,is much less sensitive to spurious awakenings than the sleep mode
sample-3501.wav,the sheep had taught him that
sample-3502.wav,i was just going to
sample-3503.wav,for at that time it had not occurred to him that it might be hollow
sample-3504.wav,absolutely despicable that gingerbread men are forced to live in houses made of their own flesh
sample-3505.wav,we don't know what's in the confounded thing do you
sample-3506.wav,you must always know what it is that you want the old king had said
sample-3507.wav,that's what i'm going to do
sample-3508.wav,most meteorites are more or less rounded
sample-3509.wav,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-3510.wav,did you hear what i said
sample-3511.wav,the criminals taunted the police officers and prison guards
sample-3512.wav,the stranger was speaking of things that very few people knew about
sample-3513.wav,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-3514.wav,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-3515.wav,but the boy was certain that he had been looking at them
sample-3516.wav,you got plenty of money
sample-3517.wav,but the merchant understood what the boy had said
sample-3518.wav,the level ground was blackened as far as one could see and it was still giving off smoke
sample-3519.wav,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-3520.wav,how many people do you think will be there
sample-3521.wav,come on with that money
sample-3522.wav,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
sample-3523.wav,why the shots stopped after the tenth no one on earth has tried to explain
sample-3524.wav,it was no more exciting than an overturned carriage or a tree blown across the road
sample-3525.wav,i wanted them to be a part of your inheritance
sample-3526.wav,i'm still having trouble with baking
sample-3527.wav,the boy was surprised at his thoughts
sample-3528.wav,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-3529.wav,can't they see it's a frame up
sample-3530.wav,is sheriff helen in there
sample-3531.wav,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
sample-3532.wav,it has happened many times before
sample-3533.wav,this is for the boy
sample-3534.wav,he restarted his efforts for the twentieth time
sample-3535.wav,don't listen to that
sample-3536.wav,he ran his fingers slowly over the stones sensing their temperature and feeling their surfaces
sample-3537.wav,you can't go any farther one of them said
sample-3538.wav,gypsies are experts at getting people to do that sighed the old man
sample-3539.wav,because they're still here
sample-3540.wav,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-3541.wav,the fact that the two hours had stretched into an entire year didn't matter
sample-3542.wav,maybe no one here knows what an alchemist is
sample-3543.wav,divers found a dead person in the lake
sample-3544.wav,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-3545.wav,here's two thousand dollars
sample-3546.wav,but bakers are more important people than shepherds
sample-3547.wav,my tax dollars pay for those public school proms
sample-3548.wav,they're forming clubs
sample-3549.wav,but they could never have taught him arabic
sample-3550.wav,we've been taken for a lot of suckers
sample-3551.wav,where's ashley's wallet
sample-3552.wav,they're starting to throw things
sample-3553.wav,so how will we name all these hurricanes
sample-3554.wav,so you got married
sample-3555.wav,you should never cross the street when the traffic light shows red
sample-3556.wav,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-3557.wav,they both spoke the same language
sample-3558.wav,why didn't i call you back
sample-3559.wav,i want to talk to you
sample-3560.wav,he had found where his treasure was and was frightened at what might happen
sample-3561.wav,you got your sea legs yet
sample-3562.wav,i had seen all that it would presently bring me
sample-3563.wav,i heard a peculiar humming sound from the pit
sample-3564.wav,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-3565.wav,no one seemed to have thought about it that night
sample-3566.wav,there were three hundred wells fifty thousand date trees and innumerable colored tents spread among them
sample-3567.wav,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-3568.wav,the alchemist turned to the boy
sample-3569.wav,but this payment goes well beyond my generosity the monk responded
sample-3570.wav,suddenly the monster disappeared
sample-3571.wav,a boy came running towards me
sample-3572.wav,i have the money i need to buy my sheep
sample-3573.wav,he became friendly with the camel driver who traveled alongside him
sample-3574.wav,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-3575.wav,who told you that asked the boy startled
sample-3576.wav,and then he perceived it very slowly
sample-3577.wav,listen to that mob
sample-3578.wav,from the railway station in the distance came the sound of trains ringing and rumbling
sample-3579.wav,the fool flew all the way up here in a blizzard
sample-3580.wav,go on out and get rid of it
sample-3581.wav,i'll have ned write it up
sample-3582.wav,she wrote the stuff
sample-3583.wav,the irish man sipped his tea
sample-3584.wav,i'm afraid that if my dream is realized i'll have no reason to go on living
sample-3585.wav,experts of geology agree yesterday's tsunami was just a herald of the imminent apocalypse
sample-3586.wav,whenever he could he sought out a new road to travel
sample-3587.wav,at this hour of the morning
sample-3588.wav,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-3589.wav,make room for mrs chelsea
sample-3590.wav,you don't know who did it
sample-3591.wav,he just got a new kite for his birthday
sample-3592.wav,last time i made the mistake of replicating a drawing by rodin
sample-3593.wav,please bring mama back
sample-3594.wav,got to get some practice
sample-3595.wav,casper predicted the outcome
sample-3596.wav,the boy reminded the old man that he had said something about hidden treasure
sample-3597.wav,this was the strangest of all things that ever came to earth from outer space
sample-3598.wav,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
sample-3599.wav,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
sample-36.wav,tomorrow sell your camel and buy a horse
sample-3601.wav,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-3602.wav,i'm going home and see my wife and family
sample-3603.wav,you can have as many babies as you like
sample-3604.wav,the man wept with happiness
sample-3605.wav,he couldn't have been wrong
sample-3606.wav,the world speaks many languages the boy thought
sample-3607.wav,the one in there
sample-3608.wav,he doesn't have anything else
sample-3609.wav,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-3610.wav,they went on smoking the pipe for a while as the sun began to set
sample-3611.wav,the battles may last for a long time perhaps even years
sample-3612.wav,it was a a kind of fascination that paralysed my actions
sample-3613.wav,this is for you he said holding one of the parts out to the monk
sample-3614.wav,let us in on it
sample-3615.wav,even then he hardly understood what this meant
sample-3616.wav,the boy noticed that the man's clothing was strange
sample-3617.wav,i've been to your house a hundred times
sample-3618.wav,the boy was relieved
sample-3619.wav,revenge is not my style but obviously accidents will happen
sample-3620.wav,it is i who dared to do so said the boy
sample-3621.wav,curse the moment i met that old man he thought
sample-3622.wav,it's all right if you want to smoke your cigar now
sample-3623.wav,the boy was shaking with fear but the alchemist helped him out of the tent
sample-3624.wav,what's she up to
sample-3625.wav,what did you stop it for
sample-3626.wav,he told her about the morning's meeting
sample-3627.wav,do you realize what you've done
sample-3628.wav,scattered groups of people were hurrying from the direction of woking
sample-3629.wav,mark untaped the package carefully
sample-3630.wav,i found a little crowd of about twenty people surrounding the huge hole
sample-3631.wav,he thought of the merchant's daughter and was sure that she had probably married
sample-3632.wav,i have the diet of a kid who found twenty dollars
sample-3633.wav,i have already found my treasure
sample-3634.wav,the boy was shocked
sample-3635.wav,it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
sample-3636.wav,the top of the cylinder was rotating on its body
sample-3637.wav,the navy's going to fly father home this afternoon
sample-3638.wav,i myself heard nothing of that
sample-3639.wav,it's true that everything has its destiny but one day that destiny will be realized
sample-3640.wav,the boy stood up shakily and looked once more at the pyramids
sample-3641.wav,and the solid part was called the philosopher's stone
sample-3642.wav,i'm not working for any other paper
sample-3643.wav,it seemed so safe and tranquil
sample-3644.wav,and it knew nothing about love
sample-3645.wav,besides that there was a heap of bicycles
sample-3646.wav,i have a taxi waiting downstairs
sample-3647.wav,you're just like father used to be
sample-3648.wav,make you're a hero sure as you're born
sample-3649.wav,my seven year resume gap is marked not drugs
sample-3650.wav,have trusted more in your love for fatima
sample-3651.wav,there must be a language that doesn't depend on words the boy thought
sample-3652.wav,but he decided first to buy his bakery and put some money aside
sample-3653.wav,it's the emerald tablet said the englishman proud that he might teach something to the boy
sample-3654.wav,the streamer of gas came out towards us
sample-3655.wav,so his heart was quiet for an entire afternoon
sample-3656.wav,the boy and the englishman had bought camels and climbed uncertainly onto their backs
sample-3657.wav,sometimes i appear in the form of a solution or a good idea
sample-3658.wav,i can always go back to being a shepherd the boy thought
sample-3659.wav,he heard a muffled grating sound and saw the black mark jerk forward an inch or so
sample-3660.wav,something inside the cylinder was unscrewing the top
sample-3661.wav,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-3662.wav,all that time the martians must have been getting ready
sample-3663.wav,the boy saw a man appear behind the counter
sample-3664.wav,the boy could certainly resist causing that kind of anxiety for the baker
sample-3665.wav,her father's awful worried about her
sample-3666.wav,you should evaluate it in a perceptual experiment
sample-3667.wav,it spread through the planet's atmosphere and obscured its more familiar features
sample-3668.wav,the englishman vanished too gone to find the alchemist
sample-3669.wav,many of our soldiers teamed up
sample-3670.wav,some of those who saw its flight say it travelled with a hissing sound
sample-3671.wav,'everyone loved them and enjoyed them
sample-3672.wav,the boy thought about the crystal merchant
sample-3673.wav,there was no other baggage
sample-3674.wav,we're refugees from the tribal wars and we need money the other figure said
sample-3675.wav,it was a tent like many at the oasis
sample-3676.wav,he decided to concentrate on more practical matters
sample-3677.wav,did you invite him to the concert
sample-3678.wav,he arose and taking up his crook began to awaken the sheep that still slept
sample-3679.wav,that night there was another jetting out of gas from the distant planet
sample-3680.wav,the walls were covered with a thick paste
sample-3681.wav,it was such a gradual movement that he found it only by noticing the dots
sample-3682.wav,who told you about omens the boy's interest was increasing by the moment
sample-3683.wav,you're not going anywhere
sample-3684.wav,in spite of this i still believed that there were men in mars
sample-3685.wav,march was windy and dark
sample-3686.wav,they tell their incredible stories at the time when you want to hear them
sample-3687.wav,they become the soul o f the world
sample-3688.wav,what's your first name
sample-3689.wav,even though the sheep didn't teach me to speak arabic
sample-3690.wav,can i get a woot woot
sample-3691.wav,a card hanging in the doorway announced that several languages were spoken in the shop
sample-3692.wav,something terrible's happened to me
sample-3693.wav,looking through the telescope i saw a circle of deep blue and the little round planet
sample-3694.wav,if a person is living out his destiny he knows everything he needs to know
sample-3695.wav,for the best part of its life the table has been standing in the basement
sample-3696.wav,but i found it difficult to get to work because of the investigations
sample-3697.wav,what about this job
sample-3698.wav,the boy became fearful the omens told him that something was wrong
sample-3699.wav,they were his treasure
sample-37.wav,it would have been visible to me had i only looked up as it passed
sample-3701.wav,the medical industry saves lives
sample-3702.wav,if i don't find it i can always go home
sample-3703.wav,don't you know that girl's very sick
sample-3704.wav,many telescopes were pointed at it
sample-3705.wav,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-3706.wav,never advertise razors by shaving a monkey it's cruel and results in lawsuits
sample-3707.wav,wait for the end of the war
sample-3708.wav,the men climbed the hill and they were tired when they reached the top
sample-3709.wav,what he said reminded the boy of the old king
sample-3710.wav,they set off running wildly into the trees
sample-3711.wav,jitterbugs john and the colonel
sample-3712.wav,but the boy couldn't even speak
sample-3713.wav,i'm smoking too much
sample-3714.wav,john catherine topped them all
sample-3715.wav,he hoped that it would be someone as capable as his previous apprentice
sample-3716.wav,the boy noticed that the owner of the bar stood nearby listening attentively to their conversation
sample-3717.wav,who's got the room next to hers
sample-3718.wav,doesn't that make sense
sample-3719.wav,given only the public key it is very hard to compute the private one
sample-3720.wav,but he still couldn't flee
sample-3721.wav,to do that successfully i must have no fear of failure
sample-3722.wav,that's a lot of hooey
sample-3723.wav,too bad he has to be fed on a bottle
sample-3724.wav,i'm going to them
sample-3725.wav,he doesn't have anything else
sample-3726.wav,but the marketplace was empty and he was far from home so he wept
sample-3727.wav,we are part of that soul so we rarely recognize that it is working for us
sample-3728.wav,their horses cried out and all their weapons were filled with sand
sample-3729.wav,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-3730.wav,and to do that you need money
sample-3731.wav,drink and enjoy yourself said the alchemist noticing that the boy was feeling happier
sample-3732.wav,and at that i told him and he took my place
sample-3733.wav,alfayoum is in egypt said the arab
sample-3734.wav,we know that and we are used to it
sample-3735.wav,i just don't trust anyone who says they've never had hamburger helper
sample-3736.wav,there's gold here he said
sample-3737.wav,motion parallax is a monocular depth cue
sample-3738.wav,in some places the ground was covered with the salt of driedup lakes
sample-3739.wav,the alchemist dismounted and told the escorts they could return to the camp
sample-3740.wav,yet it was a little too large for assurance
sample-3741.wav,who told you about omens the boy's interest was increasing by the moment
sample-3742.wav,i asked him to let me use the kitchen for a while the alchemist smiled
sample-3743.wav,the meeting was over
sample-3744.wav,they mounted their horses and rode out in the direction of the pyramids of egypt
sample-3745.wav,it spoke of journeys discoveries books and change
sample-3746.wav,love is the force that transforms and improves the soul of the world
sample-3747.wav,lighthouses in a foggy world
sample-3748.wav,you point to a trail of ants leading into the house
sample-3749.wav,the thing itself was almost entirely buried in sand
sample-3750.wav,this will help you effectively collaborate with developers and coordinate crossteam projects throughout your career
sample-3751.wav,he seemed unfriendly and had looked irritated when the boy had entered
sample-3752.wav,she just stepped out
sample-3753.wav,but he appeared to be unaware of any danger
sample-3754.wav,the camel driver was seated at the base of a palm tree observing the sunset
sample-3755.wav,we'll have something to drink and eat these hawks
sample-3756.wav,i can't think of any enemies i have
sample-3757.wav,i'll be back the boy said
sample-3758.wav,it was better than the scent of the hookahs
sample-3759.wav,too much food is being wasted
sample-3760.wav,maybe they're like me
sample-3761.wav,there was a loud shriek from a woman standing behind us
sample-3762.wav,that's why i'm here in the middle of het desert
sample-3763.wav,it sounded like a gypsy prayer
sample-3764.wav,did you see the garden that it took the master gardener ten years to create
sample-3765.wav,i believe what she said
sample-3766.wav,it was dropping off in flakes and raining down on the sand
sample-3767.wav,this morning i found a calculator taped to my wii
sample-3768.wav,the next thing the dope wants is a room
sample-3769.wav,that baker he said to himself without completing the thought
sample-3770.wav,her eye twitched uncontrollably
sample-3771.wav,arabs often appeared in the city shopping and chanting their strange prayers several times a day
sample-3772.wav,rest well tonight as if you were a warrior preparing for combat
sample-3773.wav,when i had my sheep i was happy and i made those around me happy
sample-3774.wav,you can only spit out so many seeds
sample-3775.wav,the first rule of don't fight club is let's talk about it
sample-3776.wav,the problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day
sample-3777.wav,here i am between my flock and my treasure the boy thought
sample-3778.wav,from there he could see africa in the distance
sample-3779.wav,put jackie right on the staff
sample-3780.wav,it may be the gases of the firing that caused the martians inconvenience
sample-3781.wav,the football jocks laughed viciously
sample-3782.wav,i remember how i sat on the table there in the blackness with patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes
sample-3783.wav,no sense in going up there
sample-3784.wav,i got drunk yesterday and thought i built a super computer
sample-3785.wav,but just before lunchtime a boy stopped in front of the shop
sample-3786.wav,continue in the direction of the pyramids said the alchemist
sample-3787.wav,they dismounted and the alchemist said nothing
sample-3788.wav,all things are one the boy thought
sample-3789.wav,sadly my dream of becoming a squirrel whisperer may never happen
sample-3790.wav,has aunt stephanie come in yet
sample-3791.wav,sorry but i'm allergic to that
sample-3792.wav,let's go hiking across france
sample-3793.wav,the basketball bounced off his shield of titanium
sample-3794.wav,the sun began its departure as well
sample-3795.wav,but he granted the travelers three days
sample-3796.wav,they went in to drink the tea which was served in beautiful crystal glasses
sample-3797.wav,he wanted your money he said
sample-3798.wav,lindsey promised to call you from new york tonight
sample-3799.wav,you are almost at the end of your journey said the alchemist
sample-38.wav,can you imagine bumping into a load of cops
sample-3801.wav,she had pneumonia once
sample-3802.wav,anita passed out during gymnastics she recovered quickly
sample-3803.wav,when the judge spoke the death sentence the defendant showed no emotion
sample-3804.wav,white washed walls drive me mad
sample-3805.wav,his way isn't the same as mine nor mine as his
sample-3806.wav,it's like the camel driver said 'eat when it's time to eat
sample-3807.wav,at that point in their lives everything is clear and everything is possible
sample-3808.wav,he could sell the stones and buy a return ticket
sample-3809.wav,he placed urim and thummim in the chest
sample-3810.wav,where is the treasure he asked
sample-3811.wav,ogilvy told him everything that he had seen
sample-3812.wav,ogilvy watched till one and then gave up
sample-3813.wav,well why don't we go there right now the boy asked
sample-3814.wav,but now the sounds inside had stopped
sample-3815.wav,look at it today
sample-3816.wav,he wasn't asking for help
sample-3817.wav,you lived your life in a loving way and died with dignity
sample-3818.wav,the little girl wanted to have a balloon but was too shy to ask
sample-3819.wav,i was disappointed at this inanimate bulk
sample-3820.wav,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-3821.wav,what's the matter with eleanor
sample-3822.wav,that rollercoaster was insane
sample-3823.wav,be careful with your prognostications said the stranger
sample-3824.wav,don't you know that girl's very sick
sample-3825.wav,at that time it was quite clear in my own mind that the thing had come from the planet mars
sample-3826.wav,then suddenly they kneel and die
sample-3827.wav,down below in the darkness were hundreds of people sleeping in peace
sample-3828.wav,and he knew what was the fair price for every one of his animals
sample-3829.wav,i jumped in to save rachel
sample-3830.wav,the boy said nothing
sample-3831.wav,you didn't vote for me the last time
sample-3832.wav,can i do something cassie
sample-3833.wav,it seemed to him that it fell to earth about one hundred miles east of here
sample-3834.wav,henderson went into the railway station to telegraph the news to london
sample-3835.wav,tux is not smiling he just looks nice all the time
sample-3836.wav,you'll weaken when you see that little jezebel
sample-3837.wav,it almost retained its shape
sample-3838.wav,we'll get you out in ten minutes
sample-3839.wav,the boy leapt as well but away from the alchemist
sample-3840.wav,the boy didn't say anything
sample-3841.wav,he prepared himself a sandwich and drank some hot tea from a crystal glass
sample-3842.wav,just tell them marge sent you
sample-3843.wav,he should have decided to become a shepherd the boy said
sample-3844.wav,they could barely see the boy
sample-3845.wav,just teach me to be the wind for a few moments the boy said
sample-3846.wav,what have you done with my keys
sample-3847.wav,he doesn't have anything else
sample-3848.wav,then he dropped his spade picked up his jacket and came out into the road
sample-3849.wav,he approached the mass and was surprised at the size and the shape
sample-3850.wav,you could have married anybody else in town
sample-3851.wav,but they were not there
sample-3852.wav,i have known true alchemists the alchemist continued
sample-3853.wav,we'll be down with the bags in a minute
sample-3854.wav,when i returned to the common the sun was setting
sample-3855.wav,where do you live
sample-3856.wav,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-3857.wav,some men were smoking from a gigantic pipe that they passed from one to the other
sample-3858.wav,come here a minute
sample-3859.wav,i was impatient to see it opened
sample-3860.wav,he did find it soon after dawn and not far from the sand pits
sample-3861.wav,when the sun sets the men will once again surrender their arms to me
sample-3862.wav,his arm seemed to be battling with whatever was in the hole
sample-3863.wav,we don't know when the war will end so we can't continue our journey he said
sample-3864.wav,he took out his money and counted it
sample-3865.wav,and so despite the fact that he was a roman centurion he converted to their faith
sample-3866.wav,at the first glance it was really not very exciting
sample-3867.wav,i needed immediate access
sample-3868.wav,and i'm certain you'll find it the alchemist said
sample-3869.wav,i've had this shop for thirty years
sample-3870.wav,but you want to know something
sample-3871.wav,tap on the circle to escape
sample-3872.wav,you dont compare directly to existing stateoftheart methods
sample-3873.wav,i've learned things from the sheep and i've learned things from crystal he thought
sample-3874.wav,and your camels will bring you wealth and power
sample-3875.wav,at once he connected the two incidents
sample-3876.wav,maybe these desert birds could explain to him the meaning of love without ownership
sample-3877.wav,what had been next to him five minutes ago was now at the other side
sample-3878.wav,can i help you asked the man behind the window
sample-3879.wav,the soul of the world is nourished by people's happiness
sample-3880.wav,i'm proud of it
sample-3881.wav,the shop folks were taking down their shutters and people were opening their bedroom windows
sample-3882.wav,then came the night of the first falling star
sample-3883.wav,it's a dream in the language of the world she said
sample-3884.wav,but they've got nothing to do with this case
sample-3885.wav,she's written to me every day since
sample-3886.wav,he fell asleep and when he awoke the sun was already high
sample-3887.wav,give me my book the boy said
sample-3888.wav,'m all about those invisible cosmic connections that transcend time and distance
sample-3889.wav,is it all right
sample-3890.wav,it was the pure language of the world
sample-3891.wav,it knew of the boy's talk with the desert because the winds know everything
sample-3892.wav,i forgot you were here
sample-3893.wav,hundreds of observers saw the flame that night and the night after
sample-3894.wav,when he saw henderson in his garden he called over the fence and made himself understood
sample-3895.wav,some went away while i was there and other people came
sample-3896.wav,it has happened many times before
sample-3897.wav,you can't trust anybody in this crazy world
sample-3898.wav,the shepherd swore that he would
sample-3899.wav,i'll have it in a minute
